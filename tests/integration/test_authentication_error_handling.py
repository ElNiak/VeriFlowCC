"""Real integration tests for authentication error handling and recovery scenarios.

This module focuses on testing authentication failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
that could occur in production environments, ensuring the system degrades gracefully
and provides clear error messaging for troubleshooting.

Tests focus on:
- Authentication failure recovery mechanisms
- Error propagation through the agent creation pipeline
- Subscription verification timeout and network failures
- Configuration validation in various deployment scenarios
- User-friendly error messaging for authentication issues
