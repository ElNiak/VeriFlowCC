# [2025-08-19] Recap: Real Testing Migration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agilevv/specs/2025-08-19-real-testing-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

The VeriFlowCC real testing migration successfully eliminated all mock testing infrastructure and established a comprehensive real testing framework using live Claude Code SDK integration. The migration transformed the testing approach from mock-based unit tests to authentic V-Model workflow validation that tests actual agent behavior, artifact generation, and workflow orchestration through complete end-to-end cycles.

Key completed features:

- **Complete Mock Infrastructure Removal**: Eliminated all unittest.mock, @patch decorators, MagicMock/AsyncMock instances across the entire codebase
- **Real Claude SDK Integration**: All agents now use live Claude Code SDK calls with proper authentication and session management
- **V-Model Workflow Integration Tests**: Comprehensive end-to-end workflow tests with complete artifact validation across all V-Model stages
- **Sequential Test Execution Framework**: Proper agent handoff pattern capture that validates the orchestration flow from requirements through integration
- **Artifact Validation Framework**: Structure and format validation across all V-Model stages including backlog, architecture, code, and test artifacts
- **Documentation & Developer Guides**: Complete testing approach documentation and mock-free development guide for maintaining real testing standards

## Context

Eliminate all mock testing infrastructure from VeriFlowCC and implement comprehensive real testing using live Claude Code SDK integration for V-Model orchestration validation. This migration focuses on validating actual agent behavior, artifact generation, and workflow orchestration through sequential end-to-end V-Model cycles. Tests will validate artifact format, structure, and consumability rather than mocked responses.
