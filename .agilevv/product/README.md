# VeriFlowCC - Verification Flow Command Center

## Product Overview

**VeriFlowCC** is a lightweight, open-source Claude-Code extension that brings structured Agile V-Model methodology to AI-assisted development. It's designed for individual developers who want to maintain rigorous verification and validation standards while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Individual developers using AI assistants like Claude often struggle with:

- Unstructured development workflows leading to incomplete features
- Lack of verification gates causing quality issues
- Missing traceability between requirements and implementation
- Context loss across development sessions

## Solution

VeriFlowCC provides a command-line orchestrator that:

- Enforces the Agile V-Model methodology through gated stages
- Leverages Claude-Code's native agent capabilities with enhanced context
- Maintains file-based memory for persistent project state
- Ensures every feature goes through proper V&V cycles

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Individual developers working on safety-critical or quality-focused projects
- **Secondary**: Small teams adopting AI-assisted development
- **Tertiary**: Educational institutions teaching V&V methodologies

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Structured AI Development**: Transform chaotic AI interactions into disciplined V-Model cycles
1. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in verification gates ensure code quality
1. **Traceability**: Automatic linking of requirements to tests
1. **Context Preservation**: File-based memory maintains project state across sessions
1. **Simplicity**: Lightweight tool that extends Claude-Code without complexity

## Key Features

### Implemented (Phase 0)

- [x] Project structure and documentation
- [x] Development toolchain configuration
- [x] Testing framework setup (pytest with 80% coverage requirement)
- [x] Code quality tools (ruff, mypy, pre-commit)

### Current Development (MVP Phase)

- [ ] Complete CLI with all production commands (init, plan, sprint, status, validate, checkpoint)
- [ ] Full V-Model orchestrator with all stages
- [ ] All 5 agent personas (Requirements, Design, Developer, QA, Integration)
- [ ] File-based memory management in `.agilevv/`
- [ ] State persistence and rollback capability

### Planned Features

- [ ] Agent context injection from Jinja2 templates
- [ ] Python-based hooks for workflow automation
- [ ] Git integration for checkpointing
- [ ] Sprint management commands
- [ ] Artifact generation and tracking

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of developers using the tool
- **Quality**: Reduction in defects through V&V gates
- **Efficiency**: Time saved through structured workflows
- **Satisfaction**: Developer feedback on workflow improvement

## Product Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep it lightweight and easy to use
1. **Developer-Centric**: Designed for individual coders, not enterprises
1. **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency
1. **Quality Focused**: Every feature verified and validated
1. **Context Aware**: Never lose project state or memory
