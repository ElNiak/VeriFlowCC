# Spec Summary (Lite)

Remove all hardcoded API key assumptions from VeriFlowCC documentation, code, and tests while maintaining Claude Code SDK functionality. Users should authenticate through flexible methods (subscription or API key) without explicit setup requirements, with generic error handling and graceful exit behavior when authentication fails.
