> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish comprehensive testing and validation framework for the Claude Code SDK integration to ensure reliable V-Model workflow execution with proper coverage of SDK configuration, agent operations, streaming responses, and end-to-end pipeline validation.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want comprehensive SDK integration tests so that I can confidently deploy V-Model workflows knowing all Claude Code SDK components function correctly.

**As a QA engineer**, I want automated validation of streaming responses and session management so that I can verify real-time agent feedback and context preservation across V-Model stages.

**As a system administrator**, I want robust SDK configuration testing so that I can ensure proper authentication, timeout handling, and error recovery in production environments.

## Spec Scope

- SDK Configuration validation and error handling
- Agent Factory instantiation and configuration management
- RequirementsAnalyst SDK integration testing with real/mock responses
- Streaming response handling and real-time feedback validation
- Session management and context preservation across agents
- End-to-end V-Model workflow execution with SDK integration
- Mock mode testing framework for development without API costs
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms validation
- Performance benchmarking of SDK operations
- Integration test coverage for all V-Model stage transitions

## Out of Scope

- External API rate limiting or quota management
- Third-party tool integrations (GitHub, PlantUML) beyond SDK scope
- UI/UX testing for CLI interface
- Load testing with concurrent SDK sessions
- Security penetration testing of API communications
- Cost optimization strategies for API usage

## Expected Deliverable

- Complete test suite with 90%+ coverage for SDK-integrated components
- Automated validation of streaming responses with mock and real SDK calls
- Session persistence testing across all V-Model agents
- End-to-end workflow tests demonstrating complete V-Model execution
- Performance benchmarks for SDK operations with acceptable thresholds
- Mock mode validation ensuring development workflow without API dependencies
- Error handling test cases covering timeout, authentication, and retry scenarios
- CI/CD integration ensuring all SDK tests pass before deployment
