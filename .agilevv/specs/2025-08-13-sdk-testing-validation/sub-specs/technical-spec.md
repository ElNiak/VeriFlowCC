## Approach

### Test Organization Strategy

1. **Layered Testing Approach:**

   - Unit tests for individual components (SDK config, agent factory)
   - Integration tests for agent interactions and workflow coordination
   - End-to-end tests for complete V-Model execution

1. **Test Isolation Framework Enhancement:**

   - Extend existing PathConfig system for SDK testing scenarios
   - Create specialized fixtures for SDK mock configurations
   - Implement agent state isolation between test runs

1. **Mock Strategy:**

   - Comprehensive SDK mock that simulates all response types
   - Configurable delay and failure injection for robustness testing
   - State-aware mocks that maintain session context
