# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate a fake project test manager system that enables comprehensive validation of all VeriFlowCC features and commands through realistic project scenarios. This factory-based system extends the existing test isolation framework to generate templated projects (web apps, APIs, libraries) with realistic content, enabling thorough testing of V-Model workflow execution, agent coordination, and quality gate enforcement across diverse project types and technology stacks.
