# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-14-fake-project-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Factory System Integration

- Extend existing `AgileVVDirFactory` class to support project template generation
- Integrate with current test isolation framework using `PathConfig` system
- Support all three isolation scopes: function, module, and session-scoped fixtures
- Maintain security boundaries with path traversal protection

### Project Template Engine

- Template-based project generation using configurable YAML definitions
- Support for realistic business logic generation, not just placeholder code
- File tree generation with proper directory structures and dependencies
- Integration with existing mock SDK agent system for realistic workflow testing

### Content Generation System

- Realistic source code generation for multiple programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go)
- Proper configuration file generation (pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod)
- Documentation generation (README, API docs, code comments)
- Test file generation matching project structure and testing frameworks

### CLI Integration Testing

- Automated testing of all VeriFlowCC CLI commands on generated projects
- Integration with existing mock mode for SDK-less testing
- Support for concurrent project testing with proper isolation
- Performance validation ensuring test execution remains efficient

### Quality Validation Framework

- Template validation to ensure generated projects are syntactically correct
- Workflow validation ensuring V-Model stages execute successfully on generated projects
- Agent response validation for each project type and scenario
- Metrics collection for test coverage and feature validation completeness

## Approach

### Architecture Pattern

- Leverage existing factory pattern from `AgileVVDirFactory`
- Extend current test isolation framework without breaking changes
- Use template inheritance for reusable project components
- Maintain separation of concerns between content generation and test execution

### Implementation Strategy

- Phase 1: Extend factory with basic project template support
- Phase 2: Implement realistic content generation with Faker integration
- Phase 3: Add comprehensive CLI integration testing
- Phase 4: Implement quality validation and metrics collection

### Integration Points

- `tests/fixtures/agilevv_factory.py` - Extend existing factory class
- `verifflowcc/core/path_config.py` - Leverage existing PathConfig system
- `tests/integration/` - New test suites for generated project validation
- `verifflowcc/agents/factory.py` - Integration with mock SDK agents

## External Dependencies

### New Development Dependencies

- **pyyaml** - Template definition parsing and configuration management
- **jinja2** - Advanced template rendering for complex file generation
- **faker** - Realistic fake data generation for business logic content

### Justification

- **PyYAML**: Required for defining project templates in a human-readable format that can specify complex project structures, dependencies, and content patterns
- **Jinja2**: Needed for sophisticated template rendering that can generate realistic code with variable substitution, control flow, and inheritance patterns
- **Faker**: Essential for generating realistic business data, names, addresses, and other content that makes test projects feel authentic rather than using placeholder text
