> Spec: Fake Project Integration for VeriFlowCC Testing
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate a fake project test manager system that enables comprehensive validation of all VeriFlowCC features and commands through realistic project scenarios. This system will provide templated project structures and scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the V-Model workflow execution, agent coordination, and quality gate enforcement.

## User Stories

### Test Infrastructure Enhancement

As a VeriFlowCC developer, I want to create realistic test projects programmatically so that I can validate all system features without manual project setup.

This story involves creating a factory system that can generate various project types (web apps, APIs, libraries) with realistic content including business logic, configuration files, and documentation. The system should integrate seamlessly with VeriFlowCC's existing test isolation framework.

### Comprehensive Feature Validation

As a VeriFlowCC maintainer, I want to execute full V-Model workflows on diverse project scenarios so that I can ensure all agents and quality gates work correctly across different project types.

This involves creating pre-defined project scenarios that exercise specific VeriFlowCC features like requirements analysis, architecture design, code generation, testing strategies, and integration validation. Each scenario should validate particular aspects of the system.

### Developer Experience Testing

As a VeriFlowCC user, I want to validate that the CLI commands work correctly on realistic projects so that I can trust the system for real development workflows.

This story covers testing all CLI commands (init, plan, sprint, status, validate, checkpoint) on generated projects to ensure they function correctly with various project structures and configurations.

## Spec Scope

1. **FakeProjectFactory Integration** - Factory system that extends AgileVVDirFactory with project template capabilities
1. **Project Template Library** - Collection of realistic project templates for different technology stacks and domains
1. **Scenario-Based Testing** - Pre-defined test scenarios that validate specific VeriFlowCC features and workflows
1. **CLI Command Validation** - Comprehensive testing of all VeriFlowCC CLI commands on generated projects
1. **Multi-Project Test Support** - Testing capabilities for projects with multiple components or services

## Out of Scope

- Real project hosting or deployment capabilities
- Integration with external version control systems beyond git
- Performance testing with extremely large projects (>1000 files)
- Multi-language projects in single workspace (each project focuses on one primary stack)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A factory system that can generate realistic test projects with configurable complexity and content
1. Template library supporting Python web apps, TypeScript applications, REST APIs, and CLI tools
1. Comprehensive test suite validating all VeriFlowCC features using generated projects
