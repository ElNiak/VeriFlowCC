# Acceptance Criteria â€” memory-context-manager

## AC-001: Artifact Persistence (Req: US-001)

### AC-001.1: V-Model Stage Artifact Storage

- **Given** a V-Model agent (requirements, architect, developer, qa_tester, integration) completes a stage
- **When** the agent produces stage-specific artifacts (reports, diagrams, code, test results)
- **Then** the system automatically saves all artifacts to `.agilevv/artifacts/{stage}/` with timestamp and metadata
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_artifact_persistence.py::test_stage_artifact_storage`, expected directory structure created and files present

### AC-001.2: Metadata Tracking

- **Given** artifacts are being persisted for a V-Model stage
- **When** the artifact storage operation completes
- **Then** metadata (timestamp, stage, agent_id, file_paths, checksums) is updated in `.agilevv/state.json`
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_artifact_persistence.py::test_metadata_tracking`, expected state.json contains artifact entries

### AC-001.3: Git Checkpoint Creation

- **Given** a V-Model stage completes successfully with artifacts persisted
- **When** the stage completion workflow triggers checkpoint creation
- **Then** a Git commit is created with meaningful message and tag for rollback capability
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_checkpoint_integration.py::test_git_checkpoint_creation`, expected Git commit exists with proper tags

### AC-001.4: Session Resumption

- **Given** a previous VeriFlowCC session was interrupted during V-Model execution
- **When** a new session is started in the same project directory
- **Then** the system loads previous state from `.agilevv/state.json` and allows resumption from last checkpoint
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_session_management.py::test_session_resumption`, expected state restoration and workflow continuation

## AC-002: Context Synchronization (Req: US-002)

### AC-002.1: CLAUDE.md Integration

- **Given** the project CLAUDE.md file is updated with new context or requirements
- **When** the memory manager detects file changes through file system monitoring
- **Then** the runtime context is synchronized and all agents receive updated context for next execution
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_context_sync.py::test_claude_md_integration`, expected context propagation to agent instances

### AC-002.2: Backlog Synchronization

- **Given** changes are made to `.agilevv/backlog.md` (new stories, priority updates, completion status)
- **When** the synchronization process is triggered
- **Then** the runtime state reflects backlog changes and sprint planning is updated accordingly
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_context_sync.py::test_backlog_synchronization`, expected state.json backlog consistency

### AC-002.3: Memory File Conflict Resolution

- **Given** concurrent updates to memory files (CLAUDE.md, backlog.md) occur
- **When** the system detects conflicting changes
- **Then** conflict resolution strategy is applied (last-write-wins with backup creation) and all stakeholders are notified
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_conflict_resolution.py::test_memory_conflict_handling`, expected backup files created and resolution applied

### AC-002.4: Agent Context Refresh

- **Given** memory synchronization completes with updated project context
- **When** any V-Model agent is invoked for the next operation
- **Then** the agent receives the latest synchronized context including updated requirements, architecture, and constraints
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_agent_context.py::test_context_refresh`, expected agent prompt context contains latest information

## AC-003: Sprint State Management (Req: US-003)

### AC-003.1: Sprint Initiation Tracking

- **Given** a new sprint is initiated with selected stories from the backlog
- **When** the sprint planning process completes
- **Then** sprint state is created in `.agilevv/state.json` with story assignments, estimated completion, and V-Model stage tracking
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_sprint_management.py::test_sprint_initiation`, expected sprint state structure in state.json

### AC-003.2: V-Model Stage Progress Tracking

- **Given** a sprint is active and V-Model stages are being executed
- **When** each stage (Plan, Design, Code, Verify, Validate, Integrate) completes
- **Then** the completion status is persisted with timestamp, artifacts references, and quality metrics
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_sprint_management.py::test_stage_progress_tracking`, expected stage completion markers in state

### AC-003.3: Interruption Recovery

- **Given** a sprint execution is interrupted (system crash, user termination, error condition)
- **When** VeriFlowCC is restarted in the same project
- **Then** the system resumes from the last completed V-Model stage with full context restoration
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_interruption_recovery.py::test_sprint_interruption_recovery`, expected successful resumption from checkpoint

### AC-003.4: Progress Reporting

- **Given** sprint state data is maintained throughout execution
- **When** a progress report is requested
- **Then** comprehensive status including completed stages, remaining work, quality metrics, and estimated completion is generated
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_reporting.py::test_progress_reporting`, expected report structure with accurate metrics

## AC-004: Directory Structure Management (Req: Implicit)

### AC-004.1: Automatic Directory Creation

- **Given** VeriFlowCC is initialized in a new project directory
- **When** the memory manager initializes
- **Then** the complete `.agilevv/` hierarchy is created including artifacts, checkpoints, specs, and configuration directories
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_directory_management.py::test_automatic_directory_creation`, expected directory structure exists

### AC-004.2: Permission and Security Validation

- **Given** the `.agilevv/` directory structure exists
- **When** file operations are performed by the memory manager
- **Then** appropriate file permissions are maintained and path traversal attacks are prevented
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_security.py::test_permission_validation`, expected secure file operations and permission compliance

## AC-005: System Reliability and Behavior (Req: Success Metrics)

### AC-005.1: Artifact Retrieval Reliability

- **Given** the memory manager has artifacts stored across multiple sprints
- **When** artifact retrieval operations are performed
- **Then** operations complete successfully without errors and large artifact access maintains data integrity
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/performance/test_retrieval_performance.py::test_artifact_retrieval_success`, expected successful completion and data integrity validation

### AC-005.2: Context Consistency Validation

- **Given** multiple agents are operating with synchronized context
- **When** context consistency checks are performed
- **Then** all agents have identical context hash and data consistency is preserved across operations
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/memory/test_context_consistency.py::test_multi_agent_consistency`, expected consistent context state and successful validation

### AC-005.3: Data Loss Prevention and System Response

- **Given** critical operations (artifact storage, state updates, checkpointing) are in progress
- **When** system interruptions or failures occur
- **Then** no data loss occurs, atomic operations either complete fully or rollback cleanly, and system responds reliably to user requests
- **Evidence**: tests `tests/reliability/test_data_integrity.py::test_atomic_operations`, expected zero data loss under failure conditions and reliable system response
