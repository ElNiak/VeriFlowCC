# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: memory-context-manager
> Created: 2025-08-22

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive Memory & Context Manager for VeriFlowCC that provides persistent state management, artifact tracking, and contextual memory across V-Model workflow executions. The system will maintain project continuity through file-based storage in the `.agilevv` directory structure while integrating seamlessly with Git-based checkpointing.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Artifact Persistence

**As a** VeriFlowCC developer
**I want** the system to automatically persist all V-Model stage artifacts (requirements, architecture, test reports) in structured directories
**So that** I can maintain complete traceability and resume work across sessions without losing context

**Workflow:**

1. Agent completes a V-Model stage
1. System automatically saves artifacts to `.agilevv/artifacts/{stage}/`
1. Metadata is updated in state tracking files
1. Git checkpoint is created for rollback capability

### Story 2: Context Synchronization

**As a** VeriFlowCC user
**I want** the system to synchronize project memory between CLAUDE.md, backlog.md, and runtime state
**So that** all agents have consistent, up-to-date context for informed decision-making

**Workflow:**

1. User updates project requirements or architecture
1. System detects changes and triggers context sync
1. Memory files are updated with new information
1. Agent contexts are refreshed for next execution

### Story 3: Sprint State Management

**As a** project manager using VeriFlowCC
**I want** the system to track sprint progress, story completion, and workflow state
**So that** I can resume interrupted sprints and maintain accurate project status

**Workflow:**

1. Sprint is initiated with selected stories from backlog
1. System tracks completion status of each V-Model stage
1. State is persisted across interruptions and restarts
1. Progress reports are generated from tracked state

## Spec Scope

1. **Directory Structure Management**: Automatic creation and maintenance of `.agilevv/` hierarchy including artifacts, checkpoints, and configuration directories
1. **Artifact Storage System**: File-based persistence for V-Model stage outputs with versioning, metadata tracking, and structured organization
1. **Backlog Synchronization**: Real-time synchronization between backlog.md, sprint state, and agent contexts with conflict resolution
1. **CLAUDE.md Integration**: Bidirectional sync between project memory file and runtime context with change detection and propagation
1. **Git Checkpoint Integration**: Automated checkpoint creation tied to V-Model stage completion with rollback capabilities and state recovery

## Out of Scope

- Database storage systems (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Cloud synchronization or remote storage
- Real-time collaboration features
- Binary artifact storage (images, videos, large files)
- External system integrations beyond Git
- Performance optimization for large-scale projects (>1000 artifacts)

## Success Metrics

**Leading Indicators:**

- Context consistency score across agent executions (target: >95%)
- Artifact retrieval reliability (target: 100% successful retrieval without errors)
- Context consistency maintenance (target: accurate state preserved across all sessions)

**Lagging Indicators:**

- Sprint resumption success rate after interruption (target: >98%)
- Zero data loss incidents during workflow execution
- User workflow automation (target: 80% reduction in manual intervention required)
- User satisfaction with memory system reliability (target: >4.5/5)

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- **File System Access**: Full read/write permissions to project directory and `.agilevv` subdirectories
- **Git Repository**: Project is under Git version control for checkpoint functionality
- **Python Async Environment**: Runtime supports async/await patterns for non-blocking I/O operations
- **JSON Serialization**: All state data can be serialized to JSON format for persistence
- **File Locking**: Operating system provides file locking mechanisms for concurrent access safety
- **Disk Space**: Adequate storage for artifact accumulation over project lifecycle (estimated 10-100MB per sprint)
