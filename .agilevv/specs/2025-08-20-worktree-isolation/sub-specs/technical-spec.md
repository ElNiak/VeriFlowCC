# Technical Specification

```
This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-20-worktree-isolation/spec.md
```

## Technical Requirements

- **Git Worktree Detection Algorithm** - Implement robust detection of git worktree environment using `git worktree list` and path analysis
- **Path Validation System** - Create comprehensive path validation that checks all file operations against worktree root boundaries
- **Hook Integration Framework** - Extend existing UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse hooks with worktree-aware validation logic
- **Environment Variable Management** - Implement automatic CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR configuration based on detected worktree path
- **Error Handling and User Feedback** - Provide clear, actionable error messages when worktree boundary violations are detected
- **Session State Persistence** - Maintain worktree context throughout Claude Code session lifecycle
- **VeriFlowCC Agent Integration** - Ensure all V-Model agents (requirements, architect, developer, qa, integration) respect worktree constraints
- **Configuration Inheritance** - Support worktree-specific configuration that inherits from main repository settings
- **Performance Optimization** - Implement efficient path checking that doesn't impact normal operation speed

## UI/UX Specifications

- **Startup Feedback** - Display clear worktree detection status when Claude Code launches
- **Boundary Violation Messages** - Show specific file paths and suggested alternatives when operations are blocked
- **Context Indicators** - Include worktree information in relevant hook outputs and agent responses
- **Error Recovery Guidance** - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving worktree-related issues

## Integration Requirements

- **Existing Hook System** - Seamlessly integrate with current `.claude/hooks/` architecture without breaking existing functionality
- **VeriFlowCC Orchestrator** - Ensure orchestrator and all agents operate within worktree boundaries
- **Git Integration** - Work with existing GitPython usage and git operations in the core system
- **Path Configuration** - Integrate with existing `core/path_config.py` for consistent path management
- **Agent Factory** - Extend agent creation to be worktree-aware through the factory pattern

This specification provides the technical foundation for implementing worktree isolation while maintaining compatibility with the existing VeriFlowCC architecture and ensuring optimal performance.
