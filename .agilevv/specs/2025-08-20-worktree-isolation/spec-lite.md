# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive worktree isolation for Claude Code sessions to ensure all operations are constrained to the active git worktree, preventing cross-contamination between parallel development efforts. The system will automatically detect git worktree contexts and enforce strict boundary validation through enhanced hooks, blocking any file operations that would cross worktree boundaries while providing clear error messages to developers.

This creates a foundation template as specified in the create-spec instructions for condensed spec summaries that will be used for efficient AI context usage in future sessions.
