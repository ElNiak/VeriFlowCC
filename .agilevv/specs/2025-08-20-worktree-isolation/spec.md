```
> Spec: Worktree Isolation for Claude Code Sessions
> Created: 2025-08-20
```

## Overview

```
Implement comprehensive worktree isolation for Claude Code sessions to ensure all operations are constrained to the active git worktree, preventing cross-contamination between parallel development efforts. This feature will enable developers to work safely on multiple features simultaneously without affecting each other's work.
```

## User Stories

```
### Safe Parallel Development

As a developer working on multiple features, I want to ensure that when Claude Code is launched in a specific git worktree, all its operations are confined to that worktree only, so that I can develop features independently without fear of cross-contamination.

When a developer creates a git worktree for a new feature branch and launches Claude Code from within that worktree directory, Claude should automatically detect the worktree context and restrict all file operations, git commands, and agent activities to only files within that worktree. The system should prevent any accidental modifications to files in other worktrees or the main repository, while still allowing access to shared configuration and templates that are safe to inherit.

### Automatic Environment Detection

As a developer switching between different feature worktrees, I want Claude Code to automatically adapt its working context to the current worktree, so that I don't need to manually configure isolation settings each time.

The system should detect when Claude is launched from within a git worktree and automatically configure all hooks, agents, and operations to be worktree-aware. This includes setting proper environment variables, validating file paths, and ensuring that VeriFlowCC's V-Model workflow operates within the correct context for the current feature branch.

### Error Prevention and Feedback

As a developer using Claude Code with worktrees, I want clear error messages and blocks when operations would cross worktree boundaries, so that I can maintain strict isolation and understand what actions are restricted.

When Claude attempts to access files outside the current worktree (whether through hooks, agents, or direct operations), the system should provide clear, actionable error messages explaining the boundary violation and suggest proper alternatives. This includes blocking cross-worktree file modifications while potentially allowing read-only access for reference purposes when explicitly requested.
```

## Spec Scope

```
1. **Worktree Detection System** - Automatic detection of git worktree environment and context setup
2. **Hook-Based Enforcement** - Enhanced UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse hooks for boundary validation
3. **Path Validation Framework** - Comprehensive file path validation against worktree boundaries
4. **Environment Variable Management** - Proper CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and worktree-specific configuration
5. **VeriFlowCC Integration** - Ensure all V-Model agents respect worktree constraints
```

## Out of Scope

```
- Cross-worktree synchronization or merging capabilities
- Automatic worktree creation or management
- Git worktree lifecycle management beyond detection
- Performance optimization for large worktrees
- Support for nested or linked worktrees
```

## Expected Deliverable

```
1. Claude Code sessions automatically detect and operate exclusively within the active git worktree
2. All file operations are blocked when they would cross worktree boundaries with clear error messages
3. VeriFlowCC's V-Model workflow operates correctly within worktree constraints without functionality loss
```

Follow the exact template format as specified in the create-spec instructions.
