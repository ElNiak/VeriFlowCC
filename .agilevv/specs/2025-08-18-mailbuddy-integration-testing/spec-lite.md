# MailBuddy Integration Testing with Real Claude Code SDK - Lite Summary

Validate real Claude Code SDK-powered V-Model agents using MailBuddy Flask application as authentic test context, ensuring production-ready AI agent integration with document-based session management and streaming response handling. This enhancement replaces mock implementations with authentic Claude Code SDK agents that generate real requirements, architecture, code, testing strategies, and integration decisions through structured validation frameworks.

## Key Points

- Real Claude Code SDK agent integration for all V-Model stages (Requirements, Architect, Developer, QA, Integration)
- Document-based session persistence using JSON/YAML files for conversation context across agent transitions
- Structured output validation using Pydantic schemas for authentic AI-generated artifacts and streaming response processing
