# MailBuddy Integration Testing - Lite Summary

Transform VeriFlowCC's integration tests from synthetic mock data to realistic scenarios using a minimal but functional MailBuddy Flask email application as test context. This enhancement will improve test authenticity, catch real-world integration issues, and validate V-Model agents against actual project structures while maintaining fast execution and test isolation. The implementation involves creating a basic Flask email app with realistic models and routes, then updating all existing integration tests to use MailBuddy scenarios instead of hardcoded mock responses.

## Key Points
- Replace synthetic test data with realistic MailBuddy Flask email application scenarios
- Maintain fast test execution and complete test isolation while improving authenticity
- Validate V-Model agents against actual project structures instead of mock responses
