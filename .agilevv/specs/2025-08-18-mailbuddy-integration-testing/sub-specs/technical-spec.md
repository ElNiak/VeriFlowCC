## Technical Requirements

### Claude Code SDK Integration Architecture

- **SDK Client Initialization**: Configure Claude Code SDK client with subscription-based authentication for real AI agent access
- **Document-Based Session Management**: Persist session state using simple JSON/YAML files across V-Model agent transitions with context preservation
- **Streaming Response Processing**: Handle real-time streaming responses from Claude Code SDK agents with proper buffering and display
- **Structured Output Validation**: Parse and validate JSON, YAML, and Markdown outputs from authentic AI agents using Pydantic schemas

### Real AI Agent Response Validation Framework

- **Authentic Output Quality**: Validate real Claude Code SDK agent outputs meet INVEST/SMART criteria and structured quality standards
- **SDK Response Processing**: Test parsing and validation for authentic AI-generated JSON, YAML, and Markdown content
- **Streaming Response Management**: Validate real-time streaming response handling and proper display mechanisms
- **Session Context Preservation**: Test Claude Code SDK session state persistence and conversation history across V-Model agent transitions using document-based storage

### Claude Code SDK Agent Output Validation

- **Real Requirements Analyst Validation**: Test authentic Claude Code SDK Requirements Analyst generates structured INVEST-compliant user stories with proper acceptance criteria and dependency analysis
- **Authentic Architect Response Testing**: Validate real AI Architect agent produces component diagrams, PlantUML artifacts, interface definitions, and risk assessments with MailBuddy context understanding
- **Live Developer Agent Output**: Test Claude Code SDK Developer agent generates implementable Flask code, task sequences, and technical guidance with proper test-first approach
- **AI QA Strategy Generation**: Validate real QA agent produces comprehensive testing strategies, coverage requirements, and quality metrics specific to MailBuddy application architecture
- **Real Integration Decision Making**: Test authentic Integration agent generates deployment assessments, dependency validation, and GO/NO-GO decisions with proper technical rationale

### Claude Code SDK Session and Response Management

- **Document-Based Session Storage**: Use simple JSON/YAML files to persist Claude Code SDK session state and conversation history across V-Model agent transitions
- **Streaming Response Handling**: Process real-time streaming responses from Claude Code SDK agents with proper display and buffering
- **Structured Output Processing**: Parse and validate Claude Code SDK agent responses in JSON, YAML, and Markdown formats using Pydantic schemas
- **Session Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context between Requirements, Architecture, Development, QA, and Integration agent executions through document persistence

## Approach

The implementation will follow a three-phase approach for Claude Code SDK integration:

1. **Phase 1: Real Claude Code SDK V-Model Initialization**

   - Configure authentic Claude Code SDK client with subscription-based authentication
   - Test real Requirements Analyst agent generating MailBuddy user stories with proper INVEST compliance
   - Validate authentic Architect agent producing PlantUML diagrams and Flask application design
   - Test real Developer agent implementing actual Flask routes, models, and templates
   - Showcase complete authentic AI-powered V-Model workflow execution

1. **Phase 2: SDK Integration Testing Framework**

   - Develop Claude Code SDK response validation and structured output parsing using Pydantic schemas
   - Implement streaming response handling with real-time display mechanisms
   - Create document-based session storage for conversation context persistence

1. **Phase 3: Authentic AI Workflow Validation**

   - Test session state persistence and context preservation using JSON/YAML document files
   - Validate end-to-end V-Model workflow execution with real Claude Code SDK agents
   - Ensure authentic AI-generated artifacts meet quality standards and workflow requirements

## External Dependencies

### Claude Code SDK Integration Dependencies

- **claude-code-sdk-python** - Official Claude Code SDK for real AI agent integration

- **Justification**: Provides authentic Claude API access with built-in session management and streaming capabilities for V-Model agent execution

- **pydantic (>=2.0.0)** - Structured validation for Claude Code SDK agent outputs

- **Justification**: Validates authentic AI-generated JSON, YAML, and structured content against predefined schemas for Requirements, Architecture, Development, QA, and Integration agents

### VeriFlowCC Testing Framework Dependencies

- **jsonschema (>=4.17.0)** - JSON schema validation for structured agent outputs

- **Justification**: Enables validation of Claude Code SDK agent-generated JSON artifacts and structured documents

- **pyyaml (>=6.0)** - YAML parsing for configuration and artifact validation

- **Justification**: Required for validating `.agilevv/config.yaml` and other YAML-based VeriFlowCC artifacts generated by real AI agents
