# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-18-mailbuddy-integration-testing/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-18
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### MailBuddy Flask Application Architecture
- **Application Factory Pattern**: Use Flask application factory with environment-specific configurations (development, testing, production)
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Implement User, EmailTemplate, Email, and ScheduledEmail models with proper relationships and constraints
- **Blueprint Structure**: Organize routes into logical blueprints (auth, email, templates, api) for maintainable code organization
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config classes supporting in-memory SQLite for testing and file-based SQLite for development
- **Template System**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap CSS for basic UI components (login, dashboard, email composer)

### VeriFlowCC Behavior Validation Framework
- **Artifact Quality Validation**: Test `.agilevv/` directory structure and content quality after each V-Model stage execution
- **Workflow Orchestration Testing**: Validate proper sequencing of Requirements → Architecture → Development → QA → Integration stages
- **Agent Handoff Verification**: Ensure context and artifacts are correctly passed between V-Model agents
- **Document Traceability Testing**: Verify requirements trace through architecture to implementation tasks and test specifications
- **Session State Management**: Test checkpoint creation, context preservation, and rollback functionality across agent invocations
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Validate that V-Model verification gates properly enforce quality standards before stage progression
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensure complete V-Model workflow execution completes within 2-3 minutes for realistic project scenarios

### V-Model Agent Artifact Validation
- **Requirements Analyst Output**: Validate generated requirements.md contains INVEST-compliant user stories, acceptance criteria, and dependency analysis for MailBuddy features
- **Architect Document Quality**: Test architecture.md includes component diagrams, interface definitions, risk assessments, and design decisions with proper MailBuddy context
- **Developer Task Breakdown**: Verify tasks.md contains implementable task sequences, test-first approach, and clear implementation guidance for Flask features
- **QA Strategy Documents**: Validate test-strategy.md includes comprehensive testing approach, coverage requirements, and quality metrics for email application
- **Integration Readiness Reports**: Test integration-report.md contains deployment assessment, dependency validation, and GO/NO-GO decisions with proper rationale

### Performance and Reliability Specifications
- **Test Execution Speed**: Maximum 30 seconds for complete integration test suite execution with parallel test capability
- **Memory Efficiency**: Use in-memory SQLite databases to minimize disk I/O and enable fast test setup/teardown cycles
- **Resource Isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other through proper fixture scoping and database state management
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error scenarios for testing agent resilience (database connection failures, invalid configurations, service timeouts)
- **Scalability Considerations**: Design test framework to support adding new MailBuddy features without requiring extensive test refactoring

## Approach

The implementation will follow a three-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: VeriFlowCC-Driven MailBuddy Initialization**
   - Use VeriFlowCC's V-Model workflow to initialize MailBuddy project from scratch
   - Demonstrate Requirements Analyst creating user stories for email functionality
   - Show Architect designing Flask application structure and database models
   - Validate Developer agent implementing Flask routes, models, and templates
   - Showcase complete V-Model capability for project initialization

2. **Phase 2: Integration Test Framework Enhancement**
   - Develop MailBuddyTestFactory with comprehensive test data generation
   - Implement database isolation patterns for reliable test execution
   - Create mock service implementations for external dependencies

3. **Phase 3: V-Model Agent Integration**
   - Update test fixtures to provide authentic application context
   - Implement performance benchmarking for 30-second execution target
   - Validate agent analysis capabilities with realistic application scenarios

## External Dependencies

### MailBuddy Context Dependencies (for VeriFlowCC analysis only)
- **flask (>=3.0.0)** - Core web framework for realistic project structure
- **Justification**: Provides authentic Flask application context for V-Model agents to analyze and generate artifacts about

- **flask-sqlalchemy (>=3.1.0)** - ORM for realistic database models
- **Justification**: Gives agents realistic database design scenarios to document in architecture artifacts

### VeriFlowCC Artifact Validation Dependencies
- **jsonschema (>=4.17.0)** - JSON schema validation for structured agent outputs
- **Justification**: Enables validation of agent-generated JSON artifacts and structured documents

- **pyyaml (>=6.0)** - YAML parsing for configuration and artifact validation
- **Justification**: Required for validating `.agilevv/config.yaml` and other YAML-based VeriFlowCC artifacts

- **markdown (>=3.4.0)** - Markdown parsing for document quality validation
- **Justification**: Enables content analysis of generated requirements.md, architecture.md, and task documents
