# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MailBuddy Integration Testing with Real Claude Code SDK
> Created: 2025-08-18
> Updated: 2025-08-18
> Status: Planning - Real AI Integration Only

## Overview

Transform VeriFlowCC's integration tests to validate real Claude Code SDK-powered V-Model agents using a MailBuddy Flask email application as authentic test context. This enhancement will validate actual AI agent execution, test SDK session management across workflow stages, and ensure production-ready Claude Code instance integration with proper authentication, streaming responses, and token management.

## User Stories

### Real AI Agent Validation

As a VeriFlowCC developer, I want integration tests to validate real Claude Code SDK agents analyzing MailBuddy Flask application structure, so that I can ensure production-ready AI agents generate authentic requirements, architecture, and implementation artifacts with proper session management and streaming response handling.

The developer experience involves configuring real API keys, testing Claude Code SDK authentication, validating actual AI agent outputs against quality standards, and ensuring session state persistence across the complete V-Model workflow from Requirements to Integration phases.

### Claude Code SDK Integration Validation

As a VeriFlowCC maintainer, I want comprehensive validation of Claude Code SDK integration patterns, so that I can ensure proper authentication, token management, error handling, and streaming response processing across all V-Model agent types.

This workflow involves testing SDK configuration management, API key security, session state preservation during agent handoffs, real-time streaming response validation, and comprehensive error handling for network failures, token limits, and API timeouts.

### Production-Ready AI Testing

As a CI/CD pipeline, I want integration tests to validate real Claude Code SDK functionality with controlled token usage, so that I can ensure production readiness while managing API costs and maintaining reliable test execution.

The testing framework validates real AI responses against structured output schemas, measures token consumption patterns, tests retry mechanisms for API failures, and ensures all Claude Code SDK features work correctly with the MailBuddy application context for authentic V-Model workflow execution.

## Spec Scope

1. **Claude Code SDK Authentication** - Implement and validate real API key and subscription management, SDK configuration, and secure authentication patterns for production V-Model agent execution
1. **Real AI Agent Integration** - Replace all mock agent implementations with authentic Claude Code SDK agents and validate their outputs against structured quality schemas
1. **Session State Management** - Implement and test session persistence, context preservation, and agent handoff mechanisms across complete V-Model workflows
1. **Streaming Response Validation** - Test real-time streaming responses from Claude Code SDK agents and validate proper response handling and user feedback
1. **Token Management & Cost Control** - Implement token usage monitoring, consumption patterns analysis, and cost-effective testing strategies for production readiness

## Out of Scope

- Mock agent implementations or fallback testing modes
- Synthetic/hardcoded agent responses or test data generation
- Local LLM integrations or offline agent execution
- Cost optimization through reduced API calls or cached responses
- Multi-model comparison testing or alternative AI provider integrations
- Production deployment of MailBuddy application beyond test context

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional Claude Code SDK integration with authentic V-Model agent execution using subscription-based authentication and document-based session management across all workflow stages
1. Complete integration test suite validating real AI agent outputs, structured response schemas using Pydantic validation, and streaming response handling for production readiness
1. Comprehensive validation framework ensuring authentic AI-generated artifacts meet quality standards for Requirements, Architecture, Development, QA, and Integration agents using MailBuddy Flask application context

## Validation Framework

### Real Claude Code SDK Output Validation

This specification establishes validation criteria for authentic Claude Code SDK agent outputs to ensure production-ready AI integration:

**Requirements Analyst Validation:**

- INVEST compliance scoring for user stories (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- SMART criteria validation for acceptance criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Structured JSON output validation using Pydantic schemas

**Architect Agent Validation:**

- PlantUML diagram syntax and semantic validation
- Component relationship consistency checking
- Risk assessment completeness and technical accuracy

**Developer Agent Validation:**

- Generated code syntax validation and executability testing
- Implementation task dependency analysis and ordering verification
- Technical guidance accuracy and Flask-specific pattern compliance

**QA Agent Validation:**

- Test strategy completeness and coverage requirement validation
- Quality metrics definition and measurement criteria verification
- Testing approach alignment with MailBuddy application architecture

**Integration Agent Validation:**

- GO/NO-GO decision rationale completeness and technical accuracy
- Dependency validation thoroughness and deployment readiness assessment
- Release criteria compliance and quality gate verification

All validations use Pydantic schemas for structured output parsing and maintain session context through document-based storage as defined in the API specification.
