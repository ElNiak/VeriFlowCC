# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MailBuddy Integration Testing
> Created: 2025-08-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform VeriFlowCC's integration tests from synthetic mock data to realistic scenarios using a minimal but functional MailBuddy Flask email application as test context. This enhancement will improve test authenticity, catch real-world integration issues, and validate V-Model agents against actual project structures while maintaining fast execution and test isolation.

## User Stories

### Integration Test Developer Experience

As a VeriFlowCC developer, I want integration tests to use realistic project context instead of hardcoded mocks, so that I can validate V-Model agents against real codebase scenarios and catch integration issues that synthetic tests miss.

The developer experience involves running integration tests that analyze actual Flask application structure, process real user stories like "email template management" and "scheduled delivery," and generate authentic requirements, architecture, and implementation artifacts that reflect real-world development complexity.

### V-Model Agent Validation

As a VeriFlowCC maintainer, I want agents to process realistic development scenarios, so that I can ensure the Requirements Analyst understands real user stories, the Architect designs actual system components, and the Developer implements genuine Flask features.

This workflow involves agents analyzing the MailBuddy codebase structure, generating requirements for email functionality, designing Flask application architecture, and implementing features like authentication, email templates, and scheduling services with proper validation at each V-Model stage.

### Test Execution Performance

As a CI/CD pipeline, I want integration tests to maintain fast execution speed while using real project data, so that the testing suite remains efficient for continuous validation without sacrificing authenticity.

The testing framework uses in-memory SQLite databases, mock external services (SendGrid, CouchDB), and pre-populated test fixtures to ensure all integration tests complete within 30 seconds while providing realistic Flask application context for comprehensive V-Model workflow validation.

## Spec Scope

1. **MailBuddy Flask Application** - Create minimal but realistic Flask email application with models, routes, templates, and configuration for authentic test context
2. **Integration Test Migration** - Update all existing integration tests to use MailBuddy project structure instead of synthetic mock data and responses
3. **Test Data Management** - Implement both pre-populated scenarios and dynamic test data generation for consistent and varied testing scenarios
4. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure updated tests maintain fast execution through in-memory databases and mocked external services
5. **Agent Context Enhancement** - Provide realistic user stories, codebase structure, and development artifacts for comprehensive V-Model agent validation

## Out of Scope

- Full production-ready MailBuddy application with complete email functionality
- Real external service integrations (SendGrid API, CouchDB connections)
- Multi-user authentication and authorization systems
- Production deployment configurations and scaling considerations
- UI/UX design beyond basic Flask templates
- Performance testing beyond fast test execution validation

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete MailBuddy Flask application structure with realistic models, routes, and tests that provides authentic context for V-Model agent analysis
2. All 25+ existing integration tests successfully updated to use MailBuddy scenarios instead of mock data while maintaining sub-30-second execution time
3. Comprehensive test fixture framework supporting both pre-populated MailBuddy scenarios and dynamic test data generation for varied testing coverage
