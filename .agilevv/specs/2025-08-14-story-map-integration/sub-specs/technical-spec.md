# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-14-story-map-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **StoryMapManager Component**: Python class implementing story map CRUD operations with JSON file persistence in `.agilevv/story_map.json`
- **Pydantic Data Models**: Schemas for Initiative, Epic, Feature, UserStory, and Task with validation and serialization
- **CLI Integration**: Extend existing Typer CLI with `story-map` command group for initialization, updates, and reporting
- **Agent Integration**: Modify BaseAgent class to include story map context in agent inputs and DoD validation in outputs
- **DoD Validation Framework**: Configurable YAML-based DoD criteria with automatic validation at V-Model quality gates
- **Orchestrator Enhancement**: Extend existing orchestrator to coordinate story map state during V-Model stage transitions
- **Template System**: Jinja2 templates for story map prompts integrated with existing agent prompt system
- **File Structure**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing `.agilevv/` directory structure and `backlog.md`

## Performance Considerations

- **JSON File Handling**: Use lazy loading for large story maps with incremental updates rather than full file rewrites
- **Memory Management**: Cache frequently accessed story map data during V-Model execution cycles
- **Validation Efficiency**: Implement DoD validation caching to avoid redundant criteria checks

## Integration Requirements

- **Orchestrator Coordination**: StoryMapManager integrates with existing `Orchestrator` class without breaking V-Model workflow
- **Agent Context**: All SDK-powered agents receive story map context through enhanced `_prepare_comprehensive_agent_input`
- **Quality Gate Integration**: DoD validation hooks into existing `_apply_advanced_gating` mechanism
- **State Persistence**: Story map state synchronized with existing `state.json` orchestrator state management
