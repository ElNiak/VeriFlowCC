> Spec: Story Map Integration with Definition of Done
> Created: 2025-08-14

## Overview

Integrate comprehensive story mapping and Definition of Done (DoD) validation into VeriFlowCC's Agile V-Model workflow to provide structured user story management and quality gates. This enhancement will enable individual developers to maintain rigorous traceability from user needs through validation while preserving VeriFlowCC's lightweight, file-based approach.

## User Stories

### Story Mapping Creation and Management

As a developer using VeriFlowCC, I want to create and manage story maps during Sprint 0, so that I can visualize user journeys and prioritize features effectively.

During Sprint 0, the developer can initialize a story map that captures user personas, epic structure, and feature priorities. The story map integrates with the existing `.agilevv/` artifact system and provides clear traceability from user goals to implementation tasks. The system maintains story map state across V-Model execution cycles.

### DoD Validation Integration

As a developer progressing through V-Model stages, I want automatic DoD validation at each quality gate, so that I ensure consistent quality standards and complete feature delivery.

The system validates story-specific DoD criteria at each V-Model stage (requirements, design, coding, testing, validation). Each story includes acceptance criteria that are automatically checked during agent execution. Failed DoD validation prevents progression to the next stage until criteria are met.

### Incremental Story Map Updates

As a developer completing Sprint N cycles, I want the story map to be incrementally updated based on implementation learnings, so that future sprint planning reflects actual delivery capabilities.

The system updates story priorities, effort estimates, and user journey understanding based on completed sprint results. Story map evolution is tracked and provides input for subsequent sprint planning decisions.

## Spec Scope

1. **StoryMapManager Component** - Core component for story map CRUD operations and state management
1. **Sprint 0 Story Mapping** - Integration with existing orchestrator for initial story map creation
1. **DoD Framework** - Multi-level DoD validation (story, feature, epic) integrated with V-Model quality gates
1. **CLI Commands** - New commands for story map initialization, updates, and reporting
1. **Agent Integration** - Enhanced agents that consume and update story map context during V-Model execution

## Out of Scope

- Advanced visualization dashboards (HTML/web interfaces)
- Team collaboration features or multi-user story mapping
- Integration with external project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps)
- Database storage solutions (maintaining file-based approach)
- Real-time story map collaboration or conflict resolution

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional story mapping system that integrates seamlessly with existing VeriFlowCC V-Model workflow and CLI
1. DoD validation framework that automatically enforces quality gates at each V-Model stage with configurable criteria
1. Enhanced Sprint 0 and Sprint N workflows that maintain story map context across all agent interactions and V-Model cycles
