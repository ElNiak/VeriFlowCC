> Spec: Context Engineering and Subagent Workflow Standardization
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Standardize context engineering and sequential subagent workflow patterns in VeriFlowCC to improve deterministic behavior and output quality through consistent context transfer. This enhancement will implement standardized CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 chain management where the main agent invokes subagents sequentially, each receiving standardized context and producing standardized output for the next stage.

## User Stories

### Sequential Context Transfer

As a VeriFlowCC developer, I want standardized context transfer between main agent and subagents, so that each sequential invocation receives properly formatted input and produces consistent output for the next stage.

The system will implement a main agent → TASK1/CONTEXT1 → subagent → CONTEXT2 → main agent workflow where each context transfer follows JSON Schema validation. This addresses the current challenge where context data between agent invocations lacks standardization, leading to parsing errors and inconsistent workflow execution.

### Claude Code Subagent Compliance

As a VeriFlowCC contributor, I want existing Jinja2 templates converted to Claude Code subagent format, so that the system uses native Claude Code subagent architecture instead of custom templating.

The system will transform existing templates into proper Claude Code subagent format with YAML frontmatter, single-responsibility definitions, and standardized tool permissions. This replaces the current Jinja2 approach with industry-standard subagent patterns for better integration and maintainability.

### Deterministic Context Chain

As a QA engineer using VeriFlowCC, I want validated context chain management, so that I can trace data flow and ensure consistency across sequential agent invocations.

The system will implement JSON Schema-validated context objects for each stage of the sequential workflow, ensuring that CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 transformations are predictable and traceable. This eliminates the current issue of inconsistent context formats between agent invocations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Sequential Context Transfer** - Standardize CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 chain management with JSON Schema validation for each stage
1. **Subagent Template Conversion** - Transform Jinja2 templates into Claude Code compliant subagent format with YAML frontmatter
1. **JSON Schema Output Validation** - Implement constrained decoding for guaranteed format compliance in sequential context passing
1. **Main Agent Coordination** - Enhance main agent logic for standardized subagent invocation and context management
1. **Instruction Standardization** - Update .claude/ instructions to support sequential subagent workflow patterns

## Out of Scope

- KV-cache optimization strategies (moved to future work)
- Parallel agent coordination patterns (system uses sequential workflow)
- Complete rewrite of V-Model workflow logic (enhances existing sequential pattern)
- Performance optimization beyond standardization benefits

## Expected Deliverable

1. All context transfers between main agent and subagents follow JSON Schema validation with 100% format compliance
1. Sequential agent workflow execution produces consistent CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 chains with full traceability
1. Existing Jinja2 templates successfully converted to Claude Code subagent format with maintained functionality
