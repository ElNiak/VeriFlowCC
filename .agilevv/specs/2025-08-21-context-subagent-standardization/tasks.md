  - [ ] 1.5 Implement environment variable handling for $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR and context paths
  - [ ] 1.6 Create hook chaining patterns for multi-stage validation workflows
  - [ ] 1.7 Verify all hook configuration tests pass

- [ ] 2. Context Transfer Standardization System

  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for ContextTransfer class and CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 chains
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement ContextTransfer class with serialize/deserialize methods for sequential workflow
  - [ ] 2.3 Create context validation middleware using PreToolUse hooks for format verification
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement context versioning system in .agilevv/state.json for stage tracking
  - [ ] 2.5 Create SessionStart hooks for V-Model context loading and stage initialization
  - [ ] 2.6 Establish JSON Schema validation pipeline for context objects at each stage
  - [ ] 2.7 Implement error recovery patterns for failed context transfers between agents
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify all context transfer tests pass

- [ ] 3. Claude Code Subagent Template Migration

  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for template conversion and YAML frontmatter validation
  - [ ] 3.2 Create .claude/agents/ directory structure with project-level subagent definitions
  - [ ] 3.3 Convert requirements.j2 template to .claude/agents/requirements_analyst.md format
  - [ ] 3.4 Convert architect.j2 template to .claude/agents/architect.md format
  - [ ] 3.5 Convert developer.j2 template to .claude/agents/developer.md format
  - [ ] 3.6 Convert qa.j2 and integration.j2 templates to corresponding .md subagent format
  - [ ] 3.7 Implement tool permission mapping between VeriFlowCC agents and subagent capabilities
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all template migration tests pass

- [ ] 4. Sequential Workflow Validation and Quality Gates

  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for V-Model stage validation and quality gate enforcement
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement requirements gate hook validating INVEST/SMART criteria before architecture
  - [ ] 4.3 Create architecture validation hook ensuring design completeness before development
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement code quality hook enforcing standards before testing using PostToolUse
  - [ ] 4.5 Create test validation hook verifying completion before integration using SubagentStop
  - [ ] 4.6 Implement integration gate hook for final validation before deployment approval
  - [ ] 4.7 Create comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed validations
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all validation and quality gate tests pass

- [ ] 5. System Integration and End-to-End Validation

  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for complete sequential workflow execution with all hooks active
  - [ ] 5.2 Update BaseAgent class with standardized context passing methods (send_context, receive_context)
  - [ ] 5.3 Enhance TaskAgent wrapper for Claude Code subagent invocation using Task tool
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement context chain traceability logging for debugging sequential workflows
  - [ ] 5.5 Update .claude/instructions/ files to leverage hooks for workflow coordination
  - [ ] 5.6 Create comprehensive integration tests validating CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 chains
  - [ ] 5.7 Perform end-to-end testing of complete V-Model workflow with standardized context transfer
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all integration tests pass and system meets specification deliverables
