<!-- AUTO:BEGIN EVIDENCE-TASK-CREATION-2025-08-22 -->

**Agent:** file-creator
**Date:** 2025-08-22
**Process:** Task breakdown, review, and revision for context subagent standardization

### Paths Produced/Updated

- `tasks.md` (created and revised)
- `TRACEABILITY.csv` (created)

### Reviewer Verdict

- **Initial Review Result:** REVISE (critical issues found)
- **Issues Addressed:**
  - Atomicity violations (multi-day tasks broken down)
  - Acceptance criteria mismatch (AC1-AC5 coverage gaps)
  - Task structure improvements (clearer dependencies)
- **Final Status:** Tasks revised and ready for execution
- **Review Date:** 2025-08-22

### Process Summary

- **Task Breakdown:** 7 atomic tasks (â‰¤1 day each)
- **Acceptance Criteria Coverage:** AC1-AC5 fully mapped
- **Dependencies:** Clear technical sequencing established
- **Test Strategy:** TDD approach with specific pytest commands

### Assumptions & Open Risks

- **Assumption:** Existing Claude Code SDK integration supports context transfer modifications
- **Risk:** Hook integration may require additional Claude Code configuration
- **Assumption:** Current test isolation framework will support new context transfer tests
- **Risk:** Performance impact of JSON Schema validation needs monitoring

### Traceability

Complete traceability matrix established linking tasks to acceptance criteria for audit compliance.
