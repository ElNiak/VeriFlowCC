# Spec Summary (Lite)

Standardize context engineering and sequential subagent workflow patterns in VeriFlowCC to improve deterministic behavior and output quality through consistent context transfer. Implement standardized CONTEXT1 → CONTEXT2 → CONTEXT3 chain management where the main agent invokes subagents sequentially, each receiving properly formatted input and producing consistent output for the next stage. Convert existing Jinja2 templates to Claude Code subagent format with JSON Schema validation for guaranteed format compliance.
