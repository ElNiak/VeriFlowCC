# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-21-ipython-interactive-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Typer CLI Extension**: Extend existing `verifflowcc/cli.py` with new `interactive` command that launches IPython with VeriFlowCC context loaded and custom magic commands registered
- **IPython Session Management**: Implement IPython session initialization that loads existing `.agilevv/` project state, agent configurations, and V-Model context into the interactive environment
- **Claude Code SDK Streaming Integration**: Integrate streaming responses from claude-code-sdk with IPython's display system using Rich Live components for real-time agent feedback
- **Agent Interface Layer**: Create Python API wrapper functions for all V-Model agents (Requirements, Architect, Developer, QA, Integration) that can be invoked directly from IPython console
- **Magic Command System**: Implement custom IPython magic commands (`%vmodel`, `%agent`, `%project`) for convenient access to VeriFlowCC functionality within interactive sessions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain agent context and session state across multiple interactive commands using in-memory state management with periodic saves to `.agilevv/` artifacts
- **Progress Visualization**: Implement Rich-based progress bars and live streaming displays that work seamlessly within IPython terminal environment for long-running agent operations
- **Error Handling**: Provide graceful error recovery in interactive sessions with options to retry failed operations, rollback to checkpoints, or continue with warnings

## External Dependencies

- **ipython** (>=8.10.0) - Core IPython interactive environment and magic command system

- **Justification**: Required for interactive REPL functionality, magic commands, and session management that enables the conversational V-Model experience

- **rich** (>=13.7.0) - Enhanced terminal formatting and live display components

- **Justification**: Already in tech stack but critical for progress bars and live streaming visualization of agent thoughts and decisions in interactive sessions
