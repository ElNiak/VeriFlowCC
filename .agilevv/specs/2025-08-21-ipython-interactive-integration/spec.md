# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: IPython Interactive Integration
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate IPython and claude-code-sdk to enable interactive V-Model discussions within VeriFlowCC, allowing developers to execute agents and workflows in real-time with live streaming feedback. This enhancement transforms VeriFlowCC from a purely CLI-driven tool into a hybrid interactive development environment while maintaining rigorous V-Model discipline.

## User Stories

### Interactive V-Model Execution

As a developer, I want to run VeriFlowCC agents interactively through IPython, so that I can explore requirements, validate designs, and test implementations in real-time with immediate feedback.

Workflow: Developer runs `verifflowcc interactive` to launch an enhanced IPython session, then uses commands like `run_agent('requirements')` or magic commands like `%vmodel status` to interact with the V-Model workflow. They can inspect intermediate results, modify parameters, and continue execution based on live agent feedback.

### Project State Integration

As a developer, I want to load existing VeriFlowCC project state into interactive sessions, so that I can continue work on established projects while having the flexibility to experiment and validate changes interactively.

Workflow: Developer launches interactive session in an existing project directory, automatically loading `.agilevv/` artifacts and project context. They can then run individual agents, explore alternative approaches, and either commit changes to the project state or experiment in temporary contexts.

### Live Agent Streaming

As a developer, I want to see live streaming of agent thoughts and decisions during interactive execution, so that I can understand the V-Model process and intervene if needed.

Workflow: When executing agents interactively, progress bars show execution status while live streaming displays agent reasoning, decision points, and intermediate outputs. Developer can interrupt, adjust parameters, or continue based on real-time feedback.

## Spec Scope

1. **Interactive CLI Command** - Add `verifflowcc interactive` command that launches IPython with VeriFlowCC loaded and custom magic commands available.
1. **Agent Execution Interface** - Enable individual agent invocation through Python functions and IPython magic commands with streaming output.
1. **Project State Loading** - Automatically load existing `.agilevv/` project artifacts and context into interactive sessions for seamless continuation.
1. **Session Management** - Support both persistent project sessions and temporary experimental sessions with state preservation options.
1. **Live Streaming Interface** - Implement real-time streaming of agent thoughts, decisions, and progress using Rich display components and claude-code-sdk streaming features.

## Out of Scope

- Jupyter notebook integration (IPython terminal focus only)
- Complete workflow automation (maintains interactive nature)
- Multi-project session management (single project focus)
- Custom visualization widgets beyond Rich components
- Persistent session storage across application restarts

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional `verifflowcc interactive` command that launches enhanced IPython with agent access and project state loading
1. Live streaming agent execution with progress bars and real-time feedback visible in IPython terminal
1. Seamless integration with existing VeriFlowCC V-Model workflow including all agent types (Requirements, Architect, Developer, QA, Integration)
