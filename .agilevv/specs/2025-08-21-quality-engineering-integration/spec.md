> Spec: Quality Engineering Integration for Enhanced V-Model Workflow
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive quality assurance capabilities into VeriFlowCC's Agile V-Model workflow through specialized quality agents, enhanced instructions, and strategic hooks. This enhancement will establish measurable quality gates, defect prevention mechanisms, and continuous improvement feedback loops based on formal Software Quality Engineering principles.

## User Stories

### Quality Metrics Collection and Enforcement

As a V-Model orchestrator, I want automated quality metrics collection at each stage so that quality gates can enforce measurable standards before progression.

The system will collect code complexity, test coverage, and defect density metrics throughout the development workflow. Quality gate validators will enforce configurable thresholds, blocking progression when standards are not met and providing clear remediation guidance to developers.

### Defect Prevention Through Early Detection

As a quality engineer, I want defect tracking and root cause analysis so that patterns can be identified and prevention strategies implemented.

Each defect detected during the V-Model process will be categorized, tracked, and analyzed for trends. The system will suggest preventive measures based on historical data and update quality improvement processes automatically.

### Continuous Quality Improvement

As a development team member, I want quality feedback and process optimization recommendations so that workflow efficiency improves over time.

Quality metrics will be analyzed across sprints to identify improvement opportunities. The system will provide data-driven suggestions for process optimization, tool improvements, and workflow enhancements.

## Spec Scope

1. **Quality Metrics Agents** - Specialized agents for collecting complexity, coverage, and defect metrics with structured output schemas
1. **Quality Gate Enforcement** - Validation system that blocks V-Model progression when quality thresholds are not met
1. **Defect Tracking System** - Comprehensive defect categorization, tracking, and root cause analysis capabilities
1. **Enhanced Instructions** - Updated V-Model stage instructions with quality criteria and measurable acceptance criteria
1. **Strategic Hook System** - Quality-focused hooks for gate validation, defect detection, and continuous improvement

## Out of Scope

- Complex machine learning predictive models for defect prediction
- Integration with external quality management tools or databases
- Automated code refactoring or self-healing capabilities
- Real-time quality dashboards or web interfaces
- Integration with third-party monitoring or alerting systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. Five new quality-focused agents with measurable quality validation capabilities at each V-Model stage
1. Quality gate enforcement system that maintains 80% code coverage and blocks releases with critical defects
1. Continuous improvement feedback loop that analyzes quality trends and suggests process optimizations
