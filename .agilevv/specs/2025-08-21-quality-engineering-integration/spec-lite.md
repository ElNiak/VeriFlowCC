# Quality Engineering Integration - Lite Summary

Implement comprehensive quality assurance capabilities into VeriFlowCC's Agile V-Model workflow through specialized quality agents, enhanced instructions, and strategic hooks to establish measurable quality gates and continuous improvement feedback loops. The system will enforce quality thresholds like 80% code coverage, track defects throughout the development process, and provide data-driven process optimization recommendations based on formal Software Quality Engineering principles.

## Key Points

- Integrate formal Software Quality Engineering principles into V-Model workflow with measurable quality gates and thresholds
- Implement specialized quality agents and enhanced instructions to enforce 80% code coverage and comprehensive defect tracking
- Establish continuous improvement feedback loops with data-driven process optimization recommendations
