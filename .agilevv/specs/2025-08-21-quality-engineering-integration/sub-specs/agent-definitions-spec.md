## Quality Metrics Collector Agent

**Purpose**: Automated collection of code complexity, test coverage, and quality metrics throughout the V-Model workflow.

**Responsibilities**:

- Collect cyclomatic complexity metrics from codebase analysis
- Measure test coverage percentages using coverage tools
- Calculate defect density per module and component
- Generate structured quality reports in JSON format
- Track quality trends over time across sprints

**Input Schema**:

- File paths to analyze (list of strings)
- Analysis scope (module/component/full)
- Metric types to collect (complexity, coverage, defects)

**Output Schema**:

- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive complexity)
- Coverage percentages (line, branch, function coverage)
- Defect counts and density ratios
- Quality scores and recommendations

**Tools Required**: Static analysis tools, coverage reporters, complexity analyzers

## Quality Gate Validator Agent

**Purpose**: Enforces quality thresholds at V-Model stage transitions to prevent low-quality code progression.

**Responsibilities**:

- Validate metrics against configurable quality thresholds
- Block V-Model progression when standards not met
- Provide detailed quality gate reports with remediation guidance
- Maintain quality gate configuration and policies
- Generate pass/fail decisions for stage transitions

**Input Schema**:

- Quality metrics from metrics collector
- Quality gate configuration (thresholds, rules)
- Current V-Model stage and target stage

**Output Schema**:

- Gate validation result (PASS/FAIL)
- Violated thresholds and current values
- Remediation recommendations
- Quality improvement suggestions

**Integration Points**: V-Model orchestrator, quality metrics collector

## Defect Tracker Agent

**Purpose**: Comprehensive defect categorization, tracking, and root cause analysis throughout development lifecycle.

**Responsibilities**:

- Record and categorize defects by severity, type, and origin stage
- Track defect lifecycle from detection to resolution
- Perform root cause analysis using defect patterns
- Generate defect prevention recommendations
- Maintain defect database with historical trends

**Input Schema**:

- Defect details (description, severity, type, location)
- Test results and failure information
- Code change context and author information

**Output Schema**:

- Defect tracking record with unique ID
- Categorization and severity assessment
- Root cause analysis results
- Prevention strategy recommendations

**Tools Required**: Test result parsers, code analysis tools, defect classification systems

## Test Coverage Analyzer Agent

**Purpose**: Deep analysis of test coverage gaps and prioritized testing recommendations.

**Responsibilities**:

- Analyze coverage reports for untested code paths
- Identify critical code sections lacking coverage
- Prioritize test case creation based on code criticality
- Suggest specific test scenarios for coverage gaps
- Track coverage improvements over iterations

**Input Schema**:

- Coverage reports (line, branch, function coverage)
- Code criticality rankings
- Existing test suite information

**Output Schema**:

- Coverage gap analysis with specific locations
- Prioritized list of test cases to create
- Risk assessment for untested code paths
- Coverage improvement recommendations

**Integration Points**: Testing agents, quality metrics collector, CI/CD pipeline

## Code Complexity Analyzer Agent

**Purpose**: Continuous monitoring and reduction of code complexity through targeted refactoring suggestions.

**Responsibilities**:

- Evaluate multiple complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive, nesting)
- Identify refactoring candidates based on complexity thresholds
- Suggest specific simplification strategies for complex code
- Track complexity trends and improvements over time
- Generate complexity reports with actionable recommendations

**Input Schema**:

- Source code files and directories to analyze
- Complexity thresholds and policies
- Historical complexity data for trending

**Output Schema**:

- Complexity metrics per function/method/class
- Refactoring candidate list with priorities
- Simplification strategy recommendations
- Complexity trend analysis and alerts

**Tools Required**: Complexity analyzers (radon, eslint-complexity, SonarQube), refactoring tools

## Agent Interaction Workflow

1. **Quality Metrics Collector** runs at each V-Model stage to gather current metrics
1. **Quality Gate Validator** uses metrics to enforce thresholds before stage transitions
1. **Defect Tracker** records any issues found during validation or testing
1. **Test Coverage Analyzer** identifies gaps and suggests improvements
1. **Code Complexity Analyzer** provides ongoing refactoring recommendations

All agents output structured data using Pydantic schemas for reliable inter-agent communication and integration with the V-Model orchestrator.
