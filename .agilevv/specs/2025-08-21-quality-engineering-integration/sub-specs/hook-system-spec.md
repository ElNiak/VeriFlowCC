# Hook System Specification

This is the hook system specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-21-quality-engineering-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-21
> Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

The quality engineering hook system extends VeriFlowCC's existing hook architecture with quality-specific triggers that enforce Software Quality Engineering principles at critical workflow decision points. These hooks integrate with the V-Model orchestrator and quality agents to create automated quality gates and continuous improvement feedback loops.

## PreQualityGate Hook

**Purpose**: Validates quality metrics before V-Model stage transitions to enforce quality gates.

**Trigger**: Before any V-Model stage transition (Requirements→Design, Design→Development, etc.)

**Hook Type**: PreToolUse (extends existing pattern)

**Functionality**:

- Retrieves current quality metrics from Quality Metrics Collector Agent
- Validates metrics against configured thresholds for target stage
- Blocks stage transition if quality criteria not met
- Generates detailed quality gate report with remediation steps
- Logs quality gate decisions for audit trail

**Configuration**:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  requirements_to_design:
    min_requirements_coverage: 95%
    max_ambiguous_requirements: 5
  design_to_development:
    max_design_complexity: 8
    min_interface_coverage: 90%
  development_to_testing:
    min_code_coverage: 80%
    max_cyclomatic_complexity: 10
    max_critical_defects: 0
```

**Output**: JSON report with pass/fail status and remediation guidance

## PostDefectDetection Hook

**Purpose**: Triggers automated defect tracking and root cause analysis when defects are detected.

**Trigger**: After test failures, linting errors, or quality threshold violations

**Hook Type**: PostToolUse (extends existing pattern)

**Functionality**:

- Captures defect details from test results or quality analysis
- Invokes Defect Tracker Agent for categorization and logging
- Initiates root cause analysis based on defect patterns
- Updates defect prevention strategies and recommendations
- Generates defect alerts for immediate attention

**Integration Points**:

- Test execution results
- Static analysis tool outputs
- Code review findings
- Quality metrics violations

**Defect Categories**:

- Functional defects (logic errors, incorrect behavior)
- Quality defects (performance, security, maintainability)
- Process defects (missing tests, documentation gaps)
- Integration defects (interface mismatches, data flow issues)

## QualityThresholdViolation Hook

**Purpose**: Responds to quality metric threshold violations with immediate alerts and remediation guidance.

**Trigger**: When quality metrics fall below configured thresholds

**Hook Type**: Custom quality event trigger

**Functionality**:

- Monitors quality metrics in real-time during development
- Triggers immediate alerts when thresholds violated
- Provides specific remediation actions for each violation type
- Updates quality dashboard with violation status
- Escalates persistent violations to team leads

**Threshold Types**:

- Code coverage below minimum (default: 80%)
- Complexity above maximum (default: cyclomatic complexity > 10)
- Defect density exceeding limits
- Test pass rate below threshold (default: 95%)
- Security vulnerabilities detected

**Alert Mechanisms**:

- Console warnings during development
- Quality report generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline status
- Optional team notification system

## ContinuousImprovement Hook

**Purpose**: Collects quality data at sprint completion for trend analysis and process optimization.

**Trigger**: At sprint completion or major milestone completion

**Hook Type**: SubagentStop (extends existing pattern)

**Functionality**:

- Aggregates quality metrics from entire sprint cycle
- Analyzes trends and patterns across V-Model stages
- Identifies improvement opportunities in workflow or tools
- Generates process optimization recommendations
- Updates quality baselines for future sprints

**Metrics Collection**:

- Stage-wise quality metrics and gate pass rates
- Defect injection and detection rates by stage
- Time-to-resolution for quality issues
- Process efficiency measurements
- Team productivity and quality correlation

**Improvement Recommendations**:

- Workflow optimization suggestions
- Tool integration improvements
- Training needs identification
- Quality threshold adjustments
- Process automation opportunities

## Hook Integration Architecture

### Event Flow

1. **V-Model Stage Transition** → PreQualityGate Hook validates metrics
1. **Defect Detection** → PostDefectDetection Hook logs and analyzes
1. **Threshold Violation** → QualityThresholdViolation Hook alerts and guides
1. **Sprint Completion** → ContinuousImprovement Hook analyzes and recommends

### Data Flow

- Hooks consume structured JSON data from quality agents
- Hooks produce standardized reports and recommendations
- Hook outputs integrate with V-Model orchestrator decisions
- Quality data feeds into continuous improvement analytics

### Configuration Management

- Centralized quality thresholds in `.agilevv/quality-config.yaml`
- Hook-specific settings in individual hook configuration files
- Environment-specific overrides for development vs. production
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical data

## Implementation Details

### Hook File Structure

```
.claude/hooks/Quality/
├── pre_quality_gate.py
├── post_defect_detection.py
├── quality_threshold_violation.py
└── continuous_improvement.py
```

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when quality tools unavailable
- Fallback to warning mode if critical hooks fail
- Comprehensive logging for hook execution debugging
- Recovery strategies for hook system failures

### Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous hook execution to avoid workflow blocking
- Cached quality metrics to reduce computation overhead
- Batch processing for bulk quality operations
- Resource limits to prevent hook execution runaway
