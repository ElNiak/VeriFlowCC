    required_coverage: 95.0
    max_ambiguous: 5
  design_gate:
    enabled: true
    max_complexity: 8
    min_interface_coverage: 90.0
  development_gate:
    enabled: true
    min_code_coverage: 80.0
    max_critical_defects: 0
```

### Integration with Existing VeriFlowCC Components

**Orchestrator Integration**:

- Quality agents invoked through existing `agents/factory.py`
- Quality gate validation integrated into V-Model stage transitions
- Quality metrics stored in `.agilevv/artifacts/quality/` directory
- Session persistence for quality data across V-Model stages

**SDK Configuration Updates**:

```python
# verifflowcc/core/sdk_config.py extension
class QualityConfig:
    quality_agents_timeout: int = 120
    quality_metrics_retention_days: int = 30
    quality_gate_enforcement: bool = True
    continuous_improvement_enabled: bool = True
```

## Approach

### Quality Engineering Integration Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Quality Agents)**

1. Create quality-focused agents following VeriFlowCC's agent patterns
1. Implement standardized quality metrics collection schemas
1. Establish baseline quality thresholds and configuration framework
1. Integrate with existing `agents/factory.py` for seamless agent orchestration

**Phase 2: Gate Enforcement (Hook System)**

1. Develop quality-specific hooks for pre/post quality gate operations
1. Implement quality threshold validation with blocking capabilities
1. Create defect detection and categorization mechanisms
1. Establish quality gate decision logic with pass/fail/warning states

**Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Analytics)**

1. Implement quality trend analysis across V-Model stages
1. Develop improvement recommendation algorithms
1. Create quality reporting and visualization capabilities
1. Establish feedback loops for process optimization

### Technical Implementation Approach

**Agent Development Strategy**:

- Leverage existing `agents/base.py` with Claude Code SDK integration
- Use Jinja2 templates for quality-specific prompts
- Implement async execution for non-blocking quality operations
- Apply VeriFlowCC's context engineering for optimal prompt efficiency

**Hook System Strategy**:

- Extend existing hook architecture from `.claude/hooks/`
- Implement JSON envelope pattern for consistent tool communication
- Use graceful degradation for quality tool failures
- Maintain hook execution order and dependency management

**Data Management Strategy**:

- Use existing `.agilevv/artifacts/` directory structure
- Implement JSON-based storage for quality metrics persistence
- Apply automatic cleanup based on retention policies
- Ensure data integrity through Pydantic validation

### Quality Tool Integration

**External Tool Dependencies**:

1. **radon** - Python complexity analysis (cyclomatic, cognitive complexity)
1. **coverage.py** - Test coverage measurement and reporting
1. **bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning
1. **mypy** - Static type checking for quality validation
1. **pytest-cov** - Coverage integration with existing test framework

**Tool Execution Strategy**:

- Command-line execution with structured output parsing
- Error handling for missing or failed tool executions
- Configuration management for tool-specific settings
- Resource management to prevent tool execution conflicts

### Performance and Scalability

**Execution Optimization**:

- Asynchronous quality agent execution to prevent V-Model blocking
- Incremental analysis for large codebases to reduce execution time
- Caching mechanisms for expensive quality operations
- Resource throttling to prevent system overload

**Memory and Storage Management**:

- Streaming analysis for large files to minimize memory usage
- Automatic cleanup of temporary quality analysis files
- Configurable retention policies for quality metrics
- Disk space monitoring for quality artifact storage

## External Dependencies

### Required Python Packages

```yaml
# pyproject.toml additions
dependencies = [
    "radon>=6.0.1",           # Code complexity analysis
    "coverage[toml]>=7.2.0",  # Test coverage measurement
    "bandit>=1.7.5",          # Security vulnerability scanning
    "mypy>=1.5.0",            # Static type checking
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",     # Coverage integration with pytest
]
```

### System Requirements

**Operating System Support**:

- Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) - primary support
- Windows support through WSL or compatible shell
- Python 3.9+ compatibility for all quality tools

**Performance Requirements**:

- Minimum 4GB RAM for quality analysis operations
- 1GB disk space for quality metrics storage and retention
- Network access for external quality rule updates (optional)

### Integration Requirements

**VeriFlowCC Framework Dependencies**:

- Existing Claude Code SDK configuration
- Current agent factory pattern for quality agent creation
- Hook system architecture for quality gate integration
- Existing test isolation framework for quality agent testing

**Configuration Dependencies**:

- YAML configuration parsing capabilities
- JSON schema validation for quality metrics
- File system permissions for quality artifact storage
- Environment variable management for quality tool configuration

### Tool Availability Validation

**Dependency Checking Strategy**:

```python
# Quality tool availability validation
class QualityToolValidator:
    required_tools = ["radon", "coverage", "bandit", "mypy"]

    def validate_tools(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
        """Validate availability of required quality tools"""
        # Implementation details for tool validation
        pass

    def get_fallback_options(self, missing_tools: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Provide fallback options for missing tools"""
        # Implementation details for graceful degradation
        pass
```

**Graceful Degradation Strategy**:

- Warning mode when optional quality tools are unavailable
- Core functionality maintained even with partial tool availability
- Clear error messages for missing critical dependencies
- Alternative quality validation approaches when primary tools fail

### External API Dependencies

**Optional External Services**:

- GitHub API for repository quality metrics (if repository integration enabled)
- Quality rule databases for updated complexity thresholds (optional)
- Code quality service integrations (SonarQube, CodeClimate) - future enhancement

**Network Requirements**:

- No mandatory external network dependencies
- Optional network access for quality rule updates
- Proxy support for corporate environments
- Offline operation capability for all core quality features
