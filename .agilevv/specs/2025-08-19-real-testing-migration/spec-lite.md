# Spec Summary (Lite)

Eliminate all mock testing infrastructure from VeriFlowCC and implement comprehensive real testing using live Claude Code SDK integration for V-Model orchestration validation. This migration focuses on validating actual agent behavior, artifact generation, and workflow orchestration through sequential end-to-end V-Model cycles. Tests will validate artifact format, structure, and consumability rather than mocked responses.
