# Spec Summary (Lite)

Complete the V-Model Agent System by implementing four missing agents (ArchitectAgent, DeveloperAgent, QATesterAgent, IntegrationAgent) to enable full V-Model workflow execution. This transforms VeriFlowCC from a foundational framework into a complete AI-driven development pipeline with rigorous verification and validation at each stage. All agents must integrate with the existing Orchestrator, follow established BaseAgent patterns, and support the test isolation framework for reliable operation.
