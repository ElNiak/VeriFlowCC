# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agilevv/specs/2025-08-14-claude-code-hooks/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Claude Code Hook Integration Architecture

- **Hook Events Integration**: Implement handlers for all 7 Claude Code hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact)
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based hooks.json configuration with matcher patterns and command execution following Claude Code API specifications
- **V-Model Context Tracking**: Session-persistent V-Model stage state management with atomic updates and file-based locking
- **Permission Matrix Implementation**: Stage-aware tool permission validation with configurable hard/soft gating modes
- **Command Execution Framework**: Secure subprocess execution with timeout controls, input sanitization, and structured JSON I/O

### Quality Control Pipeline

- **Multi-Language Support**: Automated quality checks for Python (ruff, mypy), JavaScript/TypeScript (biome, tsc), with extensible framework for additional languages
- **File Classification System**: Intelligent file type detection for appropriate quality tool selection (source vs test vs docs vs config)
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel hook execution, result caching, and incremental checking for modified files only
- **Quality Metrics Reporting**: Structured quality results with pass/fail status, execution time tracking, and trend analysis

### Security Validation Framework

- **Command Pattern Matching**: Regex-based dangerous command detection with configurable pattern library and whitelist exceptions
- **Path Access Control**: Restricted path validation for system directories, configuration files, and sensitive data locations
- **Input Sanitization**: Command argument validation, environment variable filtering, and injection attack prevention
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging with threat classification and response tracking

### Integration Points

- **VeriFlowCC Orchestrator Integration**: Hook lifecycle management within existing V-Model workflow execution with stage transition coordination
- **PathConfig System Integration**: Test isolation support using existing .agilevv-test/ directory structure and environment variable detection
- **SDK Configuration Integration**: Leverage existing SDKConfig for timeout management, retry logic, and agent-specific settings
- **CLI Integration**: Hook management commands integrated with verifflowcc CLI for installation, configuration, and status monitoring

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

Since this specification leverages existing VeriFlowCC infrastructure and standard Python tooling, no new external dependencies are required. The implementation uses:

- **Existing VeriFlowCC Dependencies**: pathlib, subprocess, json, threading from Python standard library
- **Current Quality Tools**: ruff, mypy, pytest (already in verifflowcc/requirements.txt via UV package manager)
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native hooks.json configuration (no additional packages required)

The hook system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing VeriFlowCC technology stack without introducing additional dependency management complexity.
