# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Claude Code Hooks (Automated Quality Control + V-Model Stage Enforcement)
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement Claude Code Hooks for VeriFlowCC to provide automated quality control and enforce V-Model stage procedures through systematic hook integration with Claude Code's native hook system. This feature will minimize development errors, ensure V-Model compliance, and maintain code quality through automated checks at key lifecycle points.

## User Stories

### Primary Hook System Implementation

As a VeriFlowCC developer, I want automated Claude Code hooks to enforce V-Model stage compliance, so that I cannot accidentally use inappropriate tools during specific development phases and maintain quality standards automatically.

The system will integrate with Claude Code's 7 hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact) to create comprehensive workflow enforcement. Hooks will validate tool usage permissions based on current V-Model stage, automatically run quality checks after code modifications, and prevent dangerous operations while maintaining developer experience.

### Quality Automation Integration

As a VeriFlowCC team member, I want quality control hooks that automatically run linting, formatting, and testing, so that code quality issues are caught and fixed immediately without manual intervention.

The quality system will trigger after file edits to run appropriate tools (ruff check --fix, mypy, pytest coverage checks) based on file types and V-Model stages. This ensures consistent code quality and reduces manual quality assurance overhead.

### Security and Safety Enforcement

As a VeriFlowCC project maintainer, I want security hooks that block dangerous commands and protect sensitive files, so that accidental system damage or security breaches are prevented.

The security system will validate bash commands before execution, blocking patterns like "rm -rf /", "sudo" commands, and operations on restricted paths like /etc/ or ~/.ssh/. This provides automated safety nets for development operations.

## Spec Scope

1. **V-Model Stage Enforcement System** - PreToolUse hooks that validate tool permissions based on current V-Model stage and agent type
1. **Automated Quality Control Pipeline** - PostToolUse hooks that automatically run linting, formatting, type checking, and test coverage validation
1. **Security Command Validation** - PreToolUse hooks for bash commands that block dangerous operations and validate restricted path access
1. **Stage Transition Management** - SubagentStop hooks that enforce quality gates before allowing V-Model stage progression
1. **Hook Configuration Template System** - Reusable hook configurations for VeriFlow projects with customizable quality thresholds and permissions

## Out of Scope

- Integration with external CI/CD systems beyond VeriFlowCC's existing workflow
- Custom hook development framework for end users (only VeriFlowCC-specific hooks)
- Real-time collaborative development features
- Integration with cloud-based development environments
- Advanced AI-powered code analysis beyond existing quality tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional Claude Code hooks configuration that enforces V-Model stage permissions and automatically runs quality checks
1. Security validation system that blocks dangerous bash commands and protects sensitive system files
1. Template generation system allowing easy hook installation for new VeriFlow projects with customizable quality thresholds
