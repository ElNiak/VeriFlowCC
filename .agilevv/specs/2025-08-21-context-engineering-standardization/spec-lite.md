# Spec Summary (Lite)

Standardize context engineering and subagent workflows through unified communication protocols, isolated execution contexts, and validated I/O schemas to achieve deterministic, high-quality agent orchestration. This will eliminate context contamination between agents, reduce token usage by 50%, and ensure 100% predictable inter-agent communication across the VeriFlowCC V-Model system.
