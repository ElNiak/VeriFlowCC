> Spec: Context Engineering and Subagent Workflow Standardization
> Created: 2025-08-21

## Overview

Implement standardized context engineering protocols and unified agent prompt templates to achieve deterministic, high-quality subagent workflows across the VeriFlowCC Agile V-Model system. This standardization will eliminate context contamination, reduce token usage by 50%, and ensure 100% predictable inter-agent communication through validated I/O schemas.

## User Stories

### Root Agent Context Management

As a root agent orchestrating V-Model workflows, I want standardized context isolation so that subagents receive only relevant context without contamination from previous steps.

The root agent will filter context based on each subagent's declared requirements, passing only necessary files and data while excluding irrelevant information. This ensures subagents can focus on their specific tasks without being confused by unrelated context, leading to more accurate and efficient processing.

### Subagent I/O Predictability

As a subagent in the V-Model pipeline, I want validated input schemas and structured output formats so that my interactions with other agents are deterministic and reliable.

Each subagent will declare its input requirements and output format using Pydantic-compatible schemas. All inputs will be validated before processing, and all outputs will conform to the declared schema, enabling reliable agent chaining and workflow automation.

### Developer Workflow Debugging

As a developer maintaining the VeriFlowCC system, I want clear context boundaries and standardized agent interfaces so that I can easily debug workflow issues and improve agent performance.

Standardized agent documentation will include explicit context requirements, I/O schemas, and working processes. Hook-based validation will enforce these contracts, providing clear error messages when agents receive incorrect inputs or produce invalid outputs.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unified Agent Template** - Standardized documentation format for all 30+ agents with context requirements, I/O schemas, and working processes
1. **Context Isolation Framework** - Hooks and validation system to filter context based on agent requirements and prevent contamination
1. **I/O Schema Validation** - Pydantic-compatible schemas for all agent inputs/outputs with automated validation
1. **Agent Standardization Guide** - Documentation and guidelines for maintaining consistent agent interfaces
1. **Hook Enhancement System** - Updated PreToolUse and UserPromptSubmit hooks for context management and validation

## Out of Scope

- Modifying Claude Code SDK integration or core orchestrator logic
- Changing existing V-Model stage definitions or workflow sequences
- Altering git workflow patterns or checkpoint mechanisms
- Creating new agent types or modifying agent core responsibilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 30+ agent documents updated with standardized templates including context requirements and I/O schemas
1. Working context isolation system that reduces token usage by 50% while maintaining workflow functionality
1. 100% validated agent communication with zero schema violations in inter-agent message passing
