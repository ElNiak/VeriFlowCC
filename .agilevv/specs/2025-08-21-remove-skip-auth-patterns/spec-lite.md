# Remove Skip Auth Patterns - Lite Summary

Remove all skip_if_no_auth patterns from VeriFlowCC test suite and assume end users are already authenticated via API key or subscription. This eliminates conditional authentication testing by removing 84+ skip_if_no_auth patterns across 14 test files and modifying validation functions to assume authentication is always available. Tests will fail fast if authentication is actually unavailable rather than skipping gracefully, simplifying the test framework architecture.

## Key Points

- Remove 84+ skip_if_no_auth pattern usages across 14 test files
- Modify validation functions to assume authentication is always available
- Tests fail fast rather than skip when authentication is unavailable
