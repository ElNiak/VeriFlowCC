# Sprint 0.5: Foundation Completion

**Sprint Duration:** 1 week (Current)
**Sprint Goal:** Complete foundational elements required for Agent-OS integration
**Sprint Type:** Foundation/Infrastructure

## Sprint Objectives

This sprint focuses on completing the foundational infrastructure that was started in Sprint 0 but needs enhancement before we can integrate Agent-OS features. We must establish robust state management, complete agent definitions, and create the verification gate framework.

## User Stories & Tasks

### Story 1: Complete Agent Context Definitions
**As a** developer
**I want** fully defined agent contexts and prompts
**So that** agents can execute their roles effectively in the V-Model pipeline

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Complete planner agent prompt with state awareness
- [ ] Define requirements-analyst full context
- [ ] Define architecture-verifier full context
- [ ] Define coder-implementer full context
- [ ] Define unit-test-writer full context
- [ ] Define acceptance-validator full context
- [ ] Add metadata headers to all agent definitions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each agent has complete prompt template
- Each agent has defined input/output schemas
- Agent roles clearly map to V-Model stages
- Metadata includes model selection (Opus vs Sonnet)

### Story 2: Establish State Management Foundation
**As a** system
**I want** persistent state management
**So that** workflows can be paused, resumed, and tracked across sessions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design state.json schema with Pydantic
- [ ] Implement StateManager class
- [ ] Create state transition validators
- [ ] Add checkpoint/rollback logic
- [ ] Create state persistence utilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- State persists between CLI sessions
- State transitions follow V-Model rules
- Invalid transitions are blocked
- State can be rolled back to checkpoints

### Story 3: Define V-Model Gate Criteria
**As a** quality engineer
**I want** clear gate criteria between stages
**So that** progression is controlled and verified

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define Planning → Design gate criteria
- [ ] Define Design → Coding gate criteria
- [ ] Define Coding → Testing gate criteria
- [ ] Define Testing → Validation gate criteria
- [ ] Create gate validation functions
- [ ] Document gate bypass procedures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each gate has measurable exit criteria
- Gate checks are automated
- Failed gates provide clear feedback
- Emergency bypass is logged and tracked

### Story 4: Create Initial Test Framework
**As a** developer
**I want** comprehensive test coverage
**So that** the system is reliable and maintainable

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up pytest infrastructure
- [ ] Create tests for Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Create tests for state transitions
- [ ] Create tests for gate validators
- [ ] Create integration test scaffold
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All schemas have validation tests
- State transitions are tested
- Gate logic is tested
- Coverage > 80%

## Technical Specifications

### State Schema Structure
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional, List, Dict

class Stage(str, Enum):
    PLANNING = "planning"
    REQUIREMENTS = "requirements"
    DESIGN = "design"
    CODING = "coding"
    TESTING = "testing"
    VALIDATION = "validation"
    COMPLETE = "complete"

class GateStatus(str, Enum):
    NOT_STARTED = "not_started"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    PASSED = "passed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    BYPASSED = "bypassed"

class SprintState(BaseModel):
    sprint_id: str
    current_stage: Stage
    previous_stage: Optional[Stage]
    gate_status: Dict[str, GateStatus]
    checkpoints: List[str]  # Git commit SHAs
    artifacts: Dict[str, str]  # Stage -> artifact path
    decisions: List[Dict]  # Decision log entries
    started_at: str
    updated_at: str
```

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| State schema too rigid | High | Medium | Design for extensibility, use versioning |
| Gate criteria too strict | Medium | High | Implement bypass mechanism with logging |
| Test coverage insufficient | High | Low | Enforce coverage in CI/CD |
| Agent definitions incomplete | High | Medium | Prioritize critical agents first |

- Python 3.10+ environment
- UV package manager configured
- Git repository initialized
- Claude API credentials available
- MCP servers configured (optional for this sprint)

## Sprint Metrics

- **Velocity Target:** 40 story points

- Add checkpoint/rollback capabilities

## Notes for Team

1. Focus on getting the foundation right - this enables everything else
2. Agent definitions can be iterative - start with core functionality
3. State management is critical - spend time on the schema design
4. Test early and often - this prevents technical debt
5. Document decisions in ADRs as we go

## Sprint Ceremonies

- **Daily Standups:** 9:30 AM
- **Sprint Review:** Friday afternoon
- **Retrospective:** Friday end of day

## Success Criteria

This sprint is successful when:
1. We can create a state, transition through stages, and persist it
2. All core agents have working definitions
3. Gate validators prevent invalid progressions
4. Tests provide confidence in the foundation
5. The team understands the architecture and can build on it
