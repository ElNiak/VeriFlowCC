# ADR-000: Why VeriFlowCC

## Status

## Date

## Context
The current landscape of AI-assisted software development presents several challenges:

1. **Lack of Structure**: Most AI coding tools generate code without systematic validation or quality gates
2. **Quality Issues**: Without proper verification, AI-generated code often contains bugs, security vulnerabilities, or doesn't meet requirements
3. **Technical Debt**: Unvalidated AI code accumulates technical debt rapidly
4. **No Traceability**: Decisions made by AI agents are often opaque with no audit trail
5. **Manual V-Model Implementation**: The Agile V-Model provides rigorous verification but is difficult and time-consuming to implement manually
6. **Context Loss**: AI agents often lose context between sessions or tasks, leading to inconsistent implementations

The Agile V-Model methodology has proven effective in safety-critical systems but requires significant manual effort. There's an opportunity to combine AI capabilities with V-Model rigor to create a structured, verifiable development pipeline.

## Decision
We will build VeriFlowCC as a structured, agent-driven development pipeline that:

1. **Enforces V-Model Stages**: Implements sequential phases with mandatory gate criteria
   - Planning → Design → Coding → Testing → Validation
   - Each stage must complete successfully before progression
   - Gate validators ensure quality at each transition

2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized AI agents for different concerns
   - Claude Opus 4.1 for strategic planning and validation (higher reasoning capability)
   - Claude Sonnet 4 for tactical execution (cost-effective for repetitive tasks)
   - Clear separation of concerns between agents

3. **Context Management**: Implements sophisticated context handling
   - Context isolation between agents to prevent confusion
   - Persistent memory (CLAUDE.md) for cross-session continuity
   - Structured data transfer via Pydantic schemas

4. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in verification and validation
   - Automated testing at each stage
   - Acceptance criteria validation
   - Code quality metrics and coverage requirements
   - Security and performance checks

5. **Checkpointing and Rollback**: Version control integration
   - Git checkpoints at stage boundaries
   - Rollback capability on failures
   - Full traceability of changes

6. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Developer remains in control
   - Approval gates for critical decisions
   - Interactive mode for review and adjustment
   - Clear visibility into agent actions

## Architectural Drivers

### Functional Requirements
- Support full software development lifecycle
- Integrate with existing development tools
- Provide CLI interface for developers
- Generate auditable documentation

### Quality Attributes
- **Reliability**: Deterministic pipeline execution with retry logic
- **Performance**: Token-efficient through context isolation
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with clear interfaces
- **Usability**: Simple CLI commands with rich feedback
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, validated inputs
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and progress tracking

### Constraints
- Must use Anthropic's Claude models
- Python 3.10+ for modern async support
- Git required for version control
- Limited by LLM context windows

### Assumptions
- Developers have basic familiarity with V-Model concepts
- Projects use git for version control
- Claude API access is available
- MCP servers can be configured for tool integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Structured Development**: Enforced methodology prevents ad-hoc coding
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in verification catches issues early
- **Traceable Decisions**: Complete audit trail of AI decisions
- **Token Efficiency**: Context isolation reduces API costs
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Checkpointing enables reliable retry
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Automates V-Model implementation
- **Consistent Quality**: Same rigor applied to every feature
- **Knowledge Retention**: Persistent memory maintains context

### Negative
- **Additional Complexity**: More complex than direct AI interaction
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand V-Model methodology
- **Potential Overhead**: May be overkill for simple tasks
- **API Dependency**: Requires reliable Claude API access
- **Initial Setup**: Requires project configuration and initialization

### Neutral
- **Git Integration**: Assumes and requires git usage
- **Opinionated Workflow**: Enforces specific development methodology
- **Token Costs**: Multiple agent calls increase API usage
- **Python Ecosystem**: Ties to Python tooling and dependencies

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Claude Integration**: Using Claude directly without structure
   - Rejected: Lacks verification and quality control

2. **Single Agent Approach**: One powerful agent for all tasks
   - Rejected: No separation of concerns, harder to optimize

3. **Poetry Instead of UV**: Traditional Python packaging
   - Rejected: UV is 10-100x faster with better UX

4. **Custom Schema Format**: Proprietary data formats
   - Rejected: Pydantic provides validation and is industry standard

5. **Waterfall V-Model**: Traditional sequential V-Model
   - Rejected: Lacks agility needed for modern development

## Implementation Plan

The implementation follows a 12-week roadmap divided into sprints:
- Sprint 0: Foundation and planning
- Sprint 1: Planner agent MVP
- Sprint 2: Coding agent MVP
- Sprint 3: Testing agent and fix loop
- Validation and GA release

See `/docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` for detailed timeline.
