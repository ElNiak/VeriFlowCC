- [ ] **Documentation Site** - Comprehensive user guide
- [ ] **Example Projects** - Demo repositories
- [ ] **CI/CD Templates** - GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Token usage reduction
- [ ] **Community Plugins** - Marketplace for extensions

**Deliverables**: V1.0 stable release with ecosystem

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Sprint (Rapid Development):

**Day 1**: Foundation

1. **Morning**: Complete CLI with all commands using Typer
1. **Afternoon**: V-Model orchestrator with state machine

**Day 2**: Agents

1. **Morning**: Base agent class and Claude API integration
1. **Afternoon**: All 5 agent personas with basic prompts

**Day 3**: Integration

1. **Morning**: Context manager and memory system
1. **Afternoon**: End-to-end workflow testing

**Day 4**: Polish

1. **Morning**: Fix issues, improve output formatting
1. **Afternoon**: Documentation and example sprint

### Technical Priorities:

1. **Simplicity**: Start with file-based everything
1. **Testability**: Write tests alongside implementation
1. **Extensibility**: Design for future agent enhancements
1. **Performance**: Optimize token usage from the start

## Success Criteria

Each phase must meet:

- [ ] 80% test coverage
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Working examples provided
- [ ] No critical bugs

## Risk Mitigation

- **Claude API Changes**: Abstract API calls through interfaces
- **Context Limits**: Implement smart context pruning
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize early
- **User Adoption**: Focus on developer experience

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Create Full CLI** (`verifflowcc/cli.py`)

   - Implement all commands: init, plan, sprint, status, validate, checkpoint
   - Use Typer with Rich for professional output
   - Add --help for all commands

1. **Build Orchestrator** (`verifflowcc/core/orchestrator.py`)

   - Full V-Model state machine
   - Stage execution with proper transitions
   - State persistence to `.agilevv/state.json`

1. **Implement Agents** (`verifflowcc/agents/`)

   - Base agent with Claude API calls
   - All 5 persona agents
   - Basic prompt templates

1. **Run Complete Sprint**

   - Initialize project: `verifflowcc init`
   - Plan sprint: `verifflowcc plan`
   - Execute: `verifflowcc sprint --story "Add task to todo list"`
   - Validate: `verifflowcc validate`

## MVP Success Criteria

- [x] All CLI commands functional
- [x] Complete V-Model cycle executes with real Claude Code SDK integration
- [x] Artifacts generated in `.agilevv/`
- [x] State persisted between commands with session management
- [x] Real code and tests generated by SDK-based agents
- [x] No placeholder implementations - full SDK integration complete
- [x] Quality gates and validation metrics implemented
- [x] Agent factory pattern with centralized SDK management
