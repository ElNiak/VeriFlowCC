# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive Typer-based CLI for VeriFlowCC with six production commands (init, plan, sprint, status, validate, checkpoint) to orchestrate the Agile V-Model workflow. The CLI provides rich terminal output with progress indicators, interactive prompts for user decisions, and complete state management through file-based persistence, serving as the primary interface for structured AI-assisted development.
