> Spec: CLI Interface Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-10

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive command-line interface for VeriFlowCC using Typer, providing all production commands needed to orchestrate the Agile V-Model workflow. This CLI will serve as the primary user interface for managing sprints, executing V-Model stages, and monitoring project state.

## User Stories

### Developer Workflow Management

As a developer, I want to use intuitive CLI commands to manage my V-Model workflow, so that I can maintain structured development practices with minimal overhead.

The developer starts by initializing a new project with `verifflowcc init`, which sets up the `.agilevv/` directory structure and configuration files. They then use `verifflowcc plan` to select and refine user stories from the backlog. When ready to implement, they execute `verifflowcc sprint --story "feature description"` which orchestrates the complete V-Model cycle through all stages. Throughout development, they can check progress with `verifflowcc status` and create checkpoints with `verifflowcc checkpoint` for safe rollback points. Finally, they run `verifflowcc validate` to ensure all acceptance criteria are met before integration.

### Sprint Execution Control

As a team lead, I want to control sprint execution through CLI commands, so that I can ensure proper verification gates are enforced at each stage.

The team lead uses the CLI to enforce quality gates throughout the sprint. They can configure soft and hard gating rules, monitor stage transitions, and intervene when verification failures occur. The CLI provides detailed status reports showing which stages have been completed, which are in progress, and any blocked items requiring attention.

### State Management and Recovery

As a developer, I want to checkpoint and restore project state, so that I can safely experiment and recover from failures.

Developers can create named checkpoints before risky changes using `verifflowcc checkpoint --name "before-refactor"`. If issues arise, they can list available checkpoints and restore to any previous state. The CLI maintains complete state persistence in `.agilevv/state.json`, ensuring no work is lost between sessions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Command Implementation** - Create all six production commands (init, plan, sprint, status, validate, checkpoint) with full functionality
1. **Rich Terminal Output** - Implement formatted output using Rich library for progress bars, tables, and syntax highlighting
1. **Interactive Prompts** - Add interactive selection menus for story selection, stage confirmation, and validation decisions
1. **State Management** - Integrate with file-based state persistence for maintaining context between commands
1. **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling with helpful messages and recovery suggestions

## Out of Scope

- Web-based UI or dashboard
- Integration with external project management tools
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Custom plugin system for extending commands
- Database backend for state storage

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional CLI application with all six commands working end-to-end
1. Professional terminal output with progress indicators and formatted displays
1. Complete integration with orchestrator for V-Model workflow execution
