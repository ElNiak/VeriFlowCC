## Implementation Notes

- **TDD Approach**: All implementation should follow test-first development
- **Test Isolation**: Use the project's test isolation framework with appropriate fixtures
- **Coverage Requirements**: Aim for 90%+ code coverage on new SDK components
- **Mock Strategy**: Implement comprehensive mocking for external SDK calls during unit tests
- **Performance Testing**: Include performance benchmarks for streaming responses and agent execution
- **Documentation**: Update test documentation to reflect new SDK testing patterns

## Dependencies

- Completion of SDK integration components (sdk_config.py, factory.py)
- Claude Code SDK access for integration testing
- Test isolation framework setup with fixtures
- Mock mode implementation for development testing
- CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated test execution

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 40 subtasks completed with passing tests
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage achieved across SDK components
- [ ] Integration tests validate real Claude Code SDK functionality
- [ ] End-to-end tests demonstrate complete V-Model workflow execution
- [ ] Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics for SDK operations
- [ ] Mock mode testing enables development without API costs
